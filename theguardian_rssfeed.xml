      <title>Beware the great 2016 financial crisis, warns leading City pessimist</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/beware-great-2016-financial-crisis-warns-city-pessimist</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Albert Edwards joins RBS in warning of a new crash, saying oil price plunge and deflation from emerging markets will overwhelm central banks, tip the markets and collapse the eurozone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The City of London’s most vocal “bear” has warned that the world is heading for a financial crisis as severe as the crash of 2008-09 that could prompt the collapse of the eurozone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albert Edwards, strategist at the bank Soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; G&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;rale, said the west was about to be hit by a wave of deflation from emerging market economies and that central banks were unaware of the disaster about to hit them. His comments came as analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/sell-everything-ahead-of-stock-market-crash-say-rbs-economists"&gt;urged investors to “sell everything”&lt;/a&gt; ahead of an imminent stock market crash. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/beware-great-2016-financial-crisis-warns-city-pessimist"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eight of 10 victims of deadly blast in Sultanahmet district believed to be German nationals, with one Peruvian also killed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A suicide bomber said by Turkey to be affiliated with Islamic State was responsible for a blast near Istanbul’s grandest tourist attractions that has killed 10 people, most of them German. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have determined that the perpetrator of the attack is a foreigner who is a member of Daesh,” prime minister Ahmet Davutoğlu said, using an Arabic acronym for Isis. “Turkey won’t backtrack in its struggle against Daesh by even one step … This terror organisation, the assailants and all of their connections will be found and they will receive the punishments they deserve.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/explosion-istanbul-square-sultanahmet-turkey"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Starving Madaya celebrates as food convoy finally arrives</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/starving-madaya-celebrates-as-food-convoy-finally-arrives</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;‘It was our first proper breakfast in four months,’ says jubilant resident after 44 lorries break siege that led to desperate scenes of deprivation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madaya was quiet on Tuesday. Its streets were empty of people or animals, just as they had been for many months. But for the first time since a brutal siege of the town began in July, residents were happy to be inside, where many ate their first full meals since the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wanted you to hear my voice. It’s different mostly because our spirits are high now,” said Ebreham Abbas, one of many Madaya residents to have received food in a much-needed aid delivery on Monday. “They finished unloading the trucks in our area at around 3.30am. Each family got sugar, 10kg of rice, hummus, green beans, two cans of tomato paste, six cans of beans and salt.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/starving-madaya-celebrates-as-food-convoy-finally-arrives"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost 200 Rhodes scholars sign statement saying grant does not buy their silence after fellow student faces backlash over protest campaign&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 200 international students at Oxford University have signed a statement saying that the prestigious Rhodes scholarship they share “does not buy [their] silence” over the legacy of Cecil Rhodes, the British imperialist who endowed the fund. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/redress-rhodes"&gt;Redress Rhodes&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Rhodes scholars who call for critical engagement with his controversial legacy within the community, wrote the statement after their fellow student, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jun/18/oxford-uni-must-decolonise-its-campus-and-curriculum-say-students"&gt;Ntokozo Qwabe, &lt;/a&gt;was accused of hypocrisy when he joined a campaign to remove a statue of Rhodes from the university’s Oriel College. Last month, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/dec/22/oxford-students-campaign-cecil-rhodes-statue-oriel-college"&gt;the Rhodes Must Fall activist group persuaded Oriel to remove a plaque&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to a man they consider to be the founding father of apartheid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/12/cecil-rhodes-scholars-reject-hypocrisy-claims-amid-row-over-oriel-college-statue"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Detective tipped off one of Rotherham grooming gang, court hears</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Complainant tells trial Basharat Hussain was a drug dealer and used to meet officer in car park and pay for information about potential arrest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A corrupt detective tipped off one of the Rotherham grooming gang about potential arrests, a court has heard. One of the 12 complainants involved in the grooming trial at Sheffield crown court said her abuser was a drug dealer who used to stash about &amp;pound;40,000 in shoeboxes in his car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman, now 30, said Basharat Hussain, one of the seven defendants in the trial, used to meet the officer in a supermarket car park for tipoffs, including inside information about attempts to arrest him. She said she also believed that the officer passed on information to Hussain about a safe house she was planning to move to in order to escape his physical abuse. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/12/detective-tipped-off-one-of-rotherham-grooming-gang-court-hears-arrest"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Polar explorer Ernest Shackleton may have had hole in his heart, doctors say</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/polar-explorer-ernest-shackleton-may-have-had-hole-in-heart-doctors-say</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers claim to find evidence in diary of explorer’s doctor that his health problems may have been caused by atrial septal defect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His expeditions into the polar unknown earned him a legacy as one of the most heroic explorers of our time. But studies into the diaries of Ernest Shackleton have led doctors to believe he may have led three British voyages to the Antarctic while suffering health problems caused by a hole in his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a piece published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, retired anaesthetist Ian Calder and consultant cardiologist Jan Till said they consulted material held in the Scott Polar Research institute – including personal diaries of Shackleton’s doctor – to get to the bottom of the explorer’s ailments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/polar-explorer-ernest-shackleton-may-have-had-hole-in-heart-doctors-say"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Bowie in America: how the US got under the singer's skin, and vice versa</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/bowie-in-america-how-the-us-got-under-the-singers-skin-and-vice-versa</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;David Bowie was dreaming of the country that would become his home since at least the 1960s.

He’s clipped on the back of the legs by Lingard, a clumsy tackle, and goes to ground before he can take a shot on goal. It should be a penalty kick, but Mike Dean isn’t giving it. That’s a dreadful decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2016-01-12T20:17:31.178Z"&gt;8.17pm &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 min: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s woken Newcastle up, though. Wijnaldum twists and turns down the left. He’s upended by Herrera near the penalty box, though it’s Smalling who goes in the book for the foul. The set piece is hit towards Coloccini at the far post, but De Gea punches clear of bother. This is a pretty entertaining affair, if not a match of the highest quality. But so what? All good fun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/jan/12/newcastle-united-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The junior doctors' protest has united my entire profession | Tamal Ray</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/12/hopeful-junior-doctors-protest-nhs</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What started as a swell of anger and disbelief among doctors has changed into something else – something that may lead to the positive change we want to see in the health service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a tough time to be working in the NHS, expected to do more with an ever-dwindling pool of resources. The cracks are showing. A&amp;amp;E waiting times are up. A “perfect storm” is brewing in General Practice as recruitment continues to fall and overworked seniors take early retirement. Cuts to social care mean that patients cannot be safely discharged from hospital, putting pressure on the limited supply of beds. There’s no point trying to hide it: we are struggling and we need help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With morale already so low, the government’s new contract proposals for junior doctors could not have come at a worse time. But as depressing as the prospect of further assaults on our working lives might be, I can’t help but feel hopeful. What started as a swell of anger and disbelief among doctors has changed into something else. For the first time in my career I can see real unity among my colleagues. Our eyes have been opened to the subtle dismantling of a healthcare system we believe in and this has inspired a movement for change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/12/hopeful-junior-doctors-protest-nhs"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The X-Files: 12 episodes to get you ready for Mulder and Scully's new series</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/12/the-x-files-12-episodes-to-get-you-ready-for-mulder-and-scullys-new-series</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first minute of the new miniseries reminds us what to expect: UFOs, freaky monsters and government conspiracies. But if you don’t fancy binge-watching all 202 episodes before it starts, which are the best ones to dip into?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My name is Fox Mulder. Since my childhood I’ve been obsessed by a controversial global phenomenon.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new X-Files miniseries starts on 24 January on Fox in the US, and will be showing in early February in the UK on Channel 5. As posted by X-Files site &lt;a href="http://www.doyoustillbelieve.com/"&gt;Do You Still Believe?&lt;/a&gt;, Mulder’s opening monologue in the first minute also serves as a handy recap of the show’s premise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/12/the-x-files-12-episodes-to-get-you-ready-for-mulder-and-scullys-new-series"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>What’s behind the huge fall in deprivation in east London?  | Lizzie Presser</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/12/what-behind-deprivation-east-london-newham-unemployment</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Newham council’s scheme to tackle unemployment and skills shortages has helped it go from being the second poorest local authority in England to the 25th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late 19th century, the Victorian &lt;a href="http://booth.lse.ac.uk/cgi-bin/do.pl?sub=view_booth_and_barth&amp;amp;args=531000,180400,6,large,5" title=""&gt;Charles Booth mapped poverty across London&lt;/a&gt;, circling Newham, in the east, black as one of the city’s worst neighbourhoods. “Lowest class; vicious, semi-criminal,” he said. Throughout the past century, Newham’s poverty has&amp;nbsp;persisted, but something has changed in the past five years. In the latest &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015" title=""&gt;English indices of deprivation&lt;/a&gt;, published last year, the borough went from being the second most deprived local authority in England to the 25th. This huge fall is part of a wider trend across east London, where a handful of districts saw huge reductions in relative deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/gallery/2015/oct/02/england-most-least-deprived-places-in-pictures"&gt;Haves and have-nots: England's most and least deprived places – in pictures&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/12/what-behind-deprivation-east-london-newham-unemployment"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Vitally important news: over-65s don't get sarcasm</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2016/jan/12/sarcasm-over-65-scientific-study-older-people</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new study concludes that older people can’t tell when others are being a bit sarky. However will they cope?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People over 65 are less able to detect and understand sarcasm, according to an immensely valuable &lt;a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/dev/51/12/1840/"&gt;study just published in Developmental Psychology&lt;/a&gt;. You might think it is obvious when somebody is saying the opposite of what they mean for comic effect. Indeed, you probably find the device so funny that you never tire of it. However, quite a lot of research now suggests that ageing tends to make people less good at perceiving emotional cues and understanding the intentions of others, thereby excluding some in later life from sarcasm’s playfulness and charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, led by Professor Louise Phillips of the University of Aberdeen, 116 participants were shown a series of videos and written stories, then asked to explain them. “For example,” the study says, “in one simple sarcasm video, a woman is busily doing a domestic task while a man reads a book and she says (sarcastically): ‘Are you busy? I know you’ve got a lot on.’” Participants were then required to answer yes or no to the questions: Is she is trying to pressure him into helping her? Is she trying to say it’s OK if he doesn’t help? Is she annoyed with him? and so on. When all the tests were marked, the 36 people who were older than 65 were just as good as the rest at understanding non-sarcastic conversations, but around seven percentage points worse on the sarcastic ones. “Older adults have problems in decoding different types of sarcasm,” the study concluded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2016/jan/12/sarcasm-over-65-scientific-study-older-people"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave detection could be a false alarm</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2016/jan/12/gravitational-wave-detection-could-be-a-false-alarm</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Caution is needed over claims that gravitational waves have been found. It could be a fake to test the detectors and scientists involved – it has been before&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a strong rumour that gravitational waves – one of astronomy’s holy grails – &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/12/gravitation-waves-signal-rumoured-science"&gt;have been found&lt;/a&gt;. Rumours have been circulating since November that ‘something’ was detected in September 2015. Analysis is currently ongoing and if everything checks out an announcement is expected in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rumour of this possible detection was first mentioned in The Guardian on &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/07/einstein-universe-gravitational-waves-theory-relativity"&gt;7 December by Paul Davies&lt;/a&gt;. Now the story has now taken on a life of its own, thanks to a tweet by the physicist and author Lawrence Krauss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2016/jan/12/gravitational-wave-detection-could-be-a-false-alarm"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Literary travel: around the world in 10 must-read books</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jan/12/literary-travel-10-must-read-books-for-travellers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ann Morgan spent a year reading a book from every country in the world – 196 in total. Here she picks 10 favourites that vividly evoke the regions they describe &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;If &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you’ve read a book with a powerful sense of place or one that inspired you to travel, we’d love to hear about it in the comments below&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, I embarked on an eccentric project. Having realised how anglocentric my reading was, I decided to try to read a novel, short story collection or memoir from every UN-recognised country, plus former UN member Taiwan (then 196 nations in all), in a calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I set up a blog, &lt;a href="http://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/"&gt;ayearofreadingtheworld.com&lt;/a&gt;, and asked the world’s book lovers to help me. Pretty soon suggestions – and even books, manuscripts and unpublished translations – were flooding in from around the planet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jan/12/literary-travel-10-must-read-books-for-travellers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Is David Cameron right to praise the ‘tiger mother’?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/12/david-cameron-amy-chua-battle-hymn-of-the-tiger-mother-parenting-abuse</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amy Chua’s 2011 memoir Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother has become a shorthand for pushy parenting, but some psychologists claim her extreme methods amount to psychological abuse. Are they really the best way to make children ‘work, try hard and believe you can succeed’?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/15/amy-chua-tiger-mother-interview" title=""&gt;Amy Chua&lt;/a&gt; published a parenting memoir in which she admitted steering her two daughters towards success with such a firm hand and ferocious tongue that child psychologists lined up to warn against the consequences: self-image &lt;a href="http://time.com/88125/the-tiger-mom-effect-is-real-says-large-study/" title=""&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt;, conflicted relationships with parents, a propensity to develop &lt;a href="http://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/24565" title=""&gt;psychiatric issues&lt;/a&gt; ... Chua was called abusive and received death threats. Shredded copies of her bestseller arrived in her post. But now she has found a surprising advocate of what she called “Chinese mothering”. David Cameron has said he wants to incorporate the key tenets of her approach into social policy. He even smuggled the book’s title – &lt;a href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/battle-hymn-of-the-tiger-mother.html" title=""&gt;Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother&lt;/a&gt; – into his &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-on-life-chances" title=""&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/15/amy-chua-tiger-mother-interview"&gt;Amy Chua: 'I'm going to take all your stuffed animals and burn them!'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/12/david-cameron-amy-chua-battle-hymn-of-the-tiger-mother-parenting-abuse"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>DNA-testing kit 23andme: patient-powered healthcare or just confusing?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/12/dna-testing-kit-23andme-patient-powered-healthcare-genetics</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The self-testing genetics kit claims to provide affordable information on potential health conditions but critics fear it could have negative implications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you fancy spitting into a tube and finding out about your genes? You can buy one online now and get details of your ancestry, carrier status of various inherited diseases, risk of common conditions and random wacky facts such as whether you’re likely to develop male-pattern baldness. Not bad for &amp;pound;124.99 from &lt;a href="http://www.superdrug.com/23andme" rel="nofollow"&gt;Superdrug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/08/anne-wojcicki-dna-genetics-testing-23andme-interview"&gt;‘Genetic testing is a responsibility if you’re having children’&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/12/dna-testing-kit-23andme-patient-powered-healthcare-genetics"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>From the backbenches to the front row – our Westminster sketchwriter goes to men’s fashion week</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/12/from-the-backbenches-to-the-front-row-what-would-our-sketchwriter-john-crace-make-of-mens-fashion-week</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;He was told off for looking at the models not the clothes, and got dirty looks for opening the freebies. What did he think of the string thongs at London Collections Men?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s all about the new Gucci, isn’t it?” Since I don’t have a clue what the old Gucci is, I decide to keep my mouth shut. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/gallery/2015/jan/13/-sp-david-gandy-watch-london-collections-men"&gt;Top male model David Gandy&lt;/a&gt; does not have the luxury of silence. As an ambassador – Our Man in Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana – for the clunkily named London Collections Men, the bloke’s equivalent of London fashion week, he’s obliged to answer any question that comes along. A foreign TV crew stick a microphone in front of him and ask his considered opinion on the effects of weather on men’s fashion shopping patterns. David mumbles something along the lines that all weather patterns can be good for shopping and the TV crew leave happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the concrete basement darkens and Gandy takes his seat alongside some other eye candy bussed in for the benefit of the fashion writers strategically placed on the front row opposite them. I’m later told that &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/20/nick-jonas-review-islington-academy-jonas-brothers-dreamboy-aims-to-please-as-solo-act"&gt;Nick Jonas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/apr/09/chloe-green-shoe-collection"&gt;Chloe Green&lt;/a&gt; were there, although I’m not sure which was which. Or who they are. But this is the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/08/topman-design-rocks-on-with-catwalk-show-of-flamboyant-menswear"&gt;Topman&lt;/a&gt; show, the LCM big-buck opener, so they must be important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/12/from-the-backbenches-to-the-front-row-what-would-our-sketchwriter-john-crace-make-of-mens-fashion-week"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Hinds review – rock'n'roll with unvarnished, adolescent energy</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/12/hinds-review-ace-hotel-london-leave-me-alone-album-launch-gig</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ace Hotel, London&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scrappy Madrid garage rockers celebrate their burgeoning success and debut album with an emotive gig that builds to a bang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering Hinds have a reputation for ramshackle gigs infused with the reckless spirit of rock’n’roll, tonight’s gig gets off to an unexpectedly surly start. No sooner have the Madrid quartet arrived onstage than they let out a collective groan, then meander into the sludgy surf rock instrumental Solar Gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/07/hinds-leave-me-alone-review-a-riotous-rush-of-girl-gang-energy"&gt;Hinds: Leave Me Alone review – a riotous rush of girl-gang energy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/12/hinds-review-ace-hotel-london-leave-me-alone-album-launch-gig"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rachel Roddy's potato gnocchi recipe</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/12/potato-gnocchi-recipe-rachel-roddy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gnocchi – or potato dumplings – are tender morsels of delight and the ideal vessel for tomato sauce, pork ragu, clams, sage butter, and a generous snow of pecorino&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will always be grateful to the person who described Testaccio – the part of Rome I call home – as being shaped like a large wedge of cheese. It’s true, with one side of the wedge provided by the straight via Marmorata, the other by the ancient city wall, with the river Tiber providing the deep curve between the two. The cheese would have to be pecorino romano, the creamy white, piquant sheep’s milk cheese so beloved in this city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first I lived in the heart of the wedge, next to the old market, then on the sharply cut side, and now I live on a street that runs parallel to the city wall and near the old slaughterhouse. In each of the three flats, I have been, more or less, above a family-run trattoria – there are dozens in this area – all of which feel like extensions of people’s homes, all of which serve up traditional food. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/12/potato-gnocchi-recipe-rachel-roddy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Drone wars: new UAV interceptor billed as net-firing solution to rogue flying</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/12/drone-wars-uav-interceptor-net-firing-solution-rogue-flying</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New capture and removal system could help in disarming unmanned aerial vehicles carrying explosive payload, without causing them to crash&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens when you have a drone flying where it shouldn’t? You send a drone to capture a drone for a bit of mid-air “robotic falconry”, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michigan Technological University’s latest drone-catcher system deploys an octacopter armed with a gun that fires out a net to entrap and carry off rogue unmanned aerial vehicles flying where they shouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/12/drone-wars-uav-interceptor-net-firing-solution-rogue-flying"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Tracey Ullman’s Show review – it’s not brave or funny enough</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/12/tracey-ullmans-show-review-not-brave-or-funny-enough</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our Trace is back on British telly after 30 years. If you’re already a fan, you’ll love her new show; if not, you might wonder what all the fuss is about&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s back. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/10/tracey-ullman-my-face-is-good-for-impersonations"&gt;Tracey Ullman&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06wp3pl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracey Ullman’s Show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (BBC1). To distinguish it from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tracey_Ullman_Show"&gt;The Tracey Ullman Show&lt;/a&gt;, presumably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Who Show? Whose Show? Who?” you ask, if you’re under 45. Tracey Ullman, big here in the 1980s, at comedy on TV (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0Ami1Xti5kA"&gt;Three of a Kind&lt;/a&gt; with Lenny Henry and David Copperfield, Girls on Top with Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders) and at singing (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiwopPbHGts"&gt;with a hairbrush&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn7_qoWDzmY"&gt;once with Neil Kinnock&lt;/a&gt;). Then she went to the US to become even bigger – winning a ton of awards, kind of spawning a famous yellow family called The Simpsons, getting into movies, becoming fabulously wealthy. But she has never forgotten where she is from (Slough), and now she returns – if not to Slough, then to British telly for the first time in 30 years or so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/12/tracey-ullmans-show-review-not-brave-or-funny-enough"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s quick, it’s delicious, and the vivid green will brighten these grey days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put a pan of water on to boil, then add 200g of frozen peas and let them cook for 3 or 4 minutes. Drain the peas and tip them into the bowl of a food processor then add 50g of rocket leaves, the juice of half a&amp;nbsp;lemon and the leaves from 10g of tarragon. Blend in 80ml of olive oil to give a smooth, bright green pur&amp;eacute;e, then set aside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/12/nigel-slater-pea-rocket-mushroom-toasts-recipe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Villa have done OK, but Palace are way more confident on the ball, and look more threatening in attack. Bacuna’s ball in is the opposite of threatening, and Palace clear easily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/jan/12/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-live"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Novak Djokovic: 'Tennis is greater than all of us'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/12/novak-djokovic-tennis-is-greater-than-all-of-us</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world No1 talks to Russell Jackson before his Australian Open title defence about the women who have most influenced him in his hugely successful career, and his holistic approach to life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paris, June 2013. Novak Djokovic has just beaten Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets to advance to the fourth round of the French Open. Nothing unusual there, nor in the immediate aftermath when he does something quintessentially Djokovician, wooing the crowd by conducting his post-match interview in the local tongue and claiming that one day he’ll open up a Serbian restaurant in their nation’s capital. The Parisians roar with delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Djokovic steps away from the cameras, heads to the locker room and immediately hears the news that had been kept from him before the match, that Jelena Gencic has died. Gencic is the matriarch of Serbian tennis and in Djokovic’s eyes its best ever coach. She’s the woman who first saw Djokovic at the age of five and decided that the fastidiously packed tennis bag this young boy had brought along with him to the local courts pointed to unteachable qualities, some innate capacity and depth of character. Here was a champion in waiting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/12/novak-djokovic-tennis-is-greater-than-all-of-us"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Manu Tuilagi can be England’s running man but needs to find his feet | Robert Kitson</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jan/12/manu-tuilagi-england-centre-leicester-six-nations</link>
      <description>There is a clamour for the Leicester centre to be hurled back into the England team but, after a 15-month absence, his return has to be managed carefully&lt;p&gt;Everyone suddenly wants a fresh piece of Manu Tuilagi. For some, a few minutes off the bench and a couple of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/10/manu-tuilagi-england-leicester-eddie-jones" title=""&gt;decent tackles against Northampton&lt;/a&gt; is deemed enough to propel him straight into England’s Six Nations plans, despite the inconvenient fact his previous game was 15 months ago. All and sundry now seem to assume that, given a couple of weeks, Manu will be ripping up whatever is put in front of him, pausing only to secure peace in the Middle East in his spare time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These same blind optimists clearly do not want to listen to Tuilagi’s coach, Richard Cockerill, who says his star centre must not be rushed after overcoming his persistent groin problem. They should also heed the recent performances for Toulon of Ma’a Nonu, currently finding rhythm elusive in France after a &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/07/new-zealand-maa-nonu-100th-cap-tonga" title=""&gt;short post-World Cup break&lt;/a&gt;. In many ways Nonu is the player England would love Tuilagi to become: a power runner with sufficiently good skills to operate at inside-centre. How interesting, then, that even the rampaging All Black, so compelling in the autumn, is finding it difficult to turn his form back on again like some bathroom tap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jan/12/manu-tuilagi-england-centre-leicester-six-nations"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The NBA Global Games match in London on Thursday is the latest display of rapid growth for basketball as it looks to attract fans from around the globe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November last year, Florida residents were not short of sunshine and the NBA season had arrived, so there was little for basketball fans to complain about. The Orlando Magic were preparing for their sixth game of the season against the visiting Toronto Raptors. It was so hot you would not have imagined Christmas was only weeks away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not unusually, given their schedule, the players failed to register that the 6 November match up was a precursor to the NBA Global Games match, which takes place at the O2 Arena in London on Thursday. The sixth of its kind, it is an event that sold out in less than an hour and the league’s latest global endeavour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/12/orlando-magic-toronto-raptors-nba-london"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Without education, Syria’s children will be a lost generation | Gordon Brown</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/syria-refugee-children-lebanon-double-shift-schools</link>
      <description>‘Double-shift’ schools in Lebanon have shown it can be done. It is imperative that money is found to give all young refugees the hope that education provides&lt;p&gt;Amid the Syrian chaos of carnage, starvation and evacuation, there is a tiny glimmer of hope. The Lebanese government has declared that it has taken 207,000 Syrian refugee children off the streets and given them places in their country’s public schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And today I am setting out a plan to extend the opportunity of education to 1 million refugee boys and girls across Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey during the course of 2016 – with the ambition that by next year every refugee child will be offered a place at school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/syria-refugee-children-lebanon-double-shift-schools"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Despite the junior doctors’ strikes, patients are with us | Anamika Basu</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/junior-doctors-strike-contract-nhs</link>
      <description>Is it really OK to work five 13-hour shifts in a row? We&amp;nbsp;junior doctors just want to be treated as people – and the people we treat understand this&lt;p&gt;So it happened. It came to a strike, and today more than 150 protests are taking place around the UK over the threat to impose a new junior doctor contract in August, despite our concerns over safety. The strike only non-urgent care, provided by junior doctors. So in fact people will still be seen today , if it is an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If negotiations still remain sour, then further strikes are planned, one of which involves removing emergency services from 8am to 5pm. Just the thought of it makes me feel ill, a reaction shared by many of my colleagues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/junior-doctors-strike-contract-nhs"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Frankie Boyle: 'I loved the idea of David Bowie as an artist'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/12/frankie-boyle-david-bowie-song-meanings</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The comedian Frankie Boyle was working at a mental health hospital when he first connected with one of Bowie’s songs. From then on, part of the pleasure of listening was to work out their stories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my early 20s, there was a period when all I owned was about a dozen CDs and a crappy Discman. I’d listen to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Sold_the_World_%28album%29"&gt;The Man Who Sold The World&lt;/a&gt; album endlessly as I sat on off-peak trains jerking around the Sussex countryside to and from the asylum I worked in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/12/generation-bowie-how-lucky-you-are"&gt;Generation Bowie, how lucky you are | Letters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/12/frankie-boyle-david-bowie-song-meanings"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Guardian view on Mein Kampf: a good new edition of a very bad old book | Editorial</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/the-guardian-view-on-mein-kampf-a-good-new-edition-of-a-very-bad-old-book</link>
      <description>Reissuing the Nazi dictator’s manifesto in Germany was bound to stoke controversy. But a scholarly re-edit does useful work in demystifying and debunking wicked words&lt;p&gt;When a group of German historians started work, &lt;a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-kampf-for-mein-kampf-annotated-version-of-hitler-polemic-in-the-works-a-676019.html" title=""&gt;six years ago&lt;/a&gt;, on an annotated version of Hitler’s Mein Kampf with the aim of republishing the text after it was due to enter the public domain on 1 January 2016, little did they know this would coincide with a time when Germany would find itself facing a rising tide of populism in the context of the refugee crisis. But even under quieter circumstances the initiative would have caused controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy years ago &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/01/mein-kampf-book-adolf-hitler-copyright-expires" title=""&gt;it fell to US occupying forces in Germany&lt;/a&gt; to decide what to do with the book, and they passed the copyright to the state government of Bavaria. Seeing&amp;nbsp;as the recently deceased author had done nothing but damage to the region’s reputation, Bavaria might well have been determined to sit on its rights and see off any thoughts of republication even if there had been no fears of rekindling a Nazi ideology that had only recently been comprehensively routed. But republishing Mein Kampf at any time was bound to raise sensitive questions. Would it not lend prominence to a hate-filled 1,000-page tome that acted as a founding document for the crimes of Nazism? Might it not risk fuelling, even today, the twisted logic of Holocaust deniers or of anyone prone to be more fascinated than repelled by Hitler? Such qualms might have been justified had the text been reprinted in its blunt form, without any effort put into debunking its sick ramblings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/the-guardian-view-on-mein-kampf-a-good-new-edition-of-a-very-bad-old-book"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>A-listers take to the Times classifieds to tell us they’re engaged and off the market – the rest of us do it for free these days&lt;p&gt;There’s only one engagement notice in the most recent edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MedwayMessenger"&gt;Medway Messenger&lt;/a&gt; (congrats, Jo and Steve!). That’s one more than in the latest &lt;a href="http://www.thanetgazette.co.uk/"&gt;Isle of Thanet Gazette&lt;/a&gt;; likewise the other local paper I read, the &lt;a href="http://www.thetottenhamindependent.co.uk/"&gt;Haringey Independent&lt;/a&gt;, whose births, deaths and marriages column is full of ads for funeral directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But romance is not dead elsewhere. Barely a week goes by without A-listers taking to the Times classifieds to tell us they’re off the market. That’s how &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/05/benedict-cumberbatch-announces-engagement-director-sophie-hunter"&gt;Benedict Cumberbatch &lt;/a&gt;did it. And &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/27678275/eddie-redmayne-reveals-engagement-to-hannah-bagshawe"&gt;Eddie Redmayne&lt;/a&gt;.

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/air-pollution-generation-quality-motor-trade</link>
      <description>The courts must be involved: the quality of air our children breathe is too important to be decided in secret by ministers and the motor trade&lt;p&gt;When I was eight years old, I used to hold my breath when I walked to school. My route was along a busy road, and I had been told that lead in petrol hurt children’s brains. I stopped worrying as the years went by and there was a successful campaign to ban it. But now I sometimes find myself coughing as I wait on my bike behind a &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/08/london-takes-just-one-week-to-breach-annual-air-pollution-limits" title=""&gt;London bus&lt;/a&gt; and its fumes catch in my throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/08/london-takes-just-one-week-to-breach-annual-air-pollution-limits"&gt;London takes just one week to breach annual air pollution limits&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/air-pollution-generation-quality-motor-trade"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Britain a nation of debt bingers? History tells a different story | Aditya Chakrabortty</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/britain-nation-debt-bingers-history-household-credit</link>
      <description>Household debt attracts easy moralising, but as a new book shows, credit used to be a badge of status&lt;p&gt;’Tis the season of self-hatred. The newspapers proffer stories ready-bent into rods to beat yourself with: you are fat and unambitious, your home full of clutter, and you almost certainly guzzle too many “units”. Most of all, you are overspent. On Christmas Day, Britons found time to spend &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35178207" title=""&gt;about &amp;pound;728m online&lt;/a&gt;, reckons credit-rating agency Experian, on Boxing Day another &amp;pound;856m. Then they went down to the shops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/28/2008-crash-government-economic-growth-budgetary-surplus"&gt;Britain is heading for another 2008 crash: here’s why | David Graeber&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/britain-nation-debt-bingers-history-household-credit"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>We will miss El Chapo: he was easy to blame for our drug war failures | Peter Andreas</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/el-chapo-capture-failures-of-drug-war-mexico-us</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The head of the Sinaloa cartel has long been used as a way to distract people from messy truths that we’d rather ignore&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Chapo gave the international drug trade a high-profile recognizable face – and we will miss him now that he is gone. It is always convenient– whether for politicians, bureaucrats, journalists, scriptwriters or the larger public – for a problem to have a familiar face to hate and target. Al Capone was the face of Prohibition-era organized crime, Pablo Escobar the face of Colombia’s cocaine wars and Osama Bin Laden the face of transnational terrorism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is far easier to blame and go after a ruthless individual or set of individuals for problems that have deeper, messier, more complex roots. In the case of El Chapo, having him at the top of the “most wanted” list creates flashy headlines, sells newspapers, justifies budgets and provides tough sounding political sound bites; extreme poverty and displacement in Mexico and other Latin American drug exporting countries and woefully inadequate drug treatment and addiction research in the United States and other consumer countries do not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/el-chapo-capture-failures-of-drug-war-mexico-us"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Junior doctors are striking for us all – to save the NHS and to make a stand | Owen Jones</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/junior-doctor-strike-save-nhs-stand-up-government</link>
      <description>This landmark strike is not just about pay and working conditions; it’s about showing that resistance to the government is possible&lt;p&gt;If we need a reminder of why we should be focusing fire on the government – not the internal machinations of the opposition – then today is it. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/12/junior-doctors-strike-begins" title=""&gt;England’s junior doctors&lt;/a&gt; have been driven &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/live/2016/jan/12/junior-doctors-strike-in-england-live-updates" title=""&gt;into their first national strike for four decades&lt;/a&gt;. Usually politicians and the media attempt to unpick the legitimacy of the strike: with 98% of those balloted by the British Medical Association (BMA) having backed a walkout, they daren’t. A near-unanimous show of support tells us that these pillars of the National Health Service are in a state of revolt, that their morale is catastrophically poor, and that they are extremely determined. But this isn’t simply about their contracts – the catalyst for the strike. It’s about the NHS, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/12/gps-train-junior-doctors-dispute-threatens-survival"&gt;All GPs train as junior doctors in hospitals – this dispute threatens our survival | Zara Azizl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/junior-doctor-strike-save-nhs-stand-up-government"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/david-cameron-parenting-classes-childrens-centres-cuts</link>
      <description>In this latest farce, David Cameron offers parenting classes – but good luck in finding out who will deliver them&lt;p&gt;In darkest January all governments need a lift. David Cameron needs a breather from banging on about Europe with something eye-catching and domestic. What better than the family, and the dysfunction of the poor? He does it well, if you disregard the disconnect between what he says and everything he does. He’s like a ventriloquist with a dummy of himself on his knee: keep listening to his puppet, don’t look while he does something quite different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/11/david-cameron-no-conflict-improving-lives-cutting-benefits-poverty"&gt;PM says 'no conflict' between fighting poverty and cutting benefits&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/david-cameron-parenting-classes-childrens-centres-cuts"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Private tenants are crying out for a living rent commission | Caroline Lucas</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/private-tenants-living-rent-commision</link>
      <description>The campaign for a limit on rent hikes and a fair deal for private sector renters won’t stop until the government admits failure and starts looking for solutions&lt;p&gt;Every time it seems that the housing crisis couldn’t get any worse, it does. Our &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/10/council-tenants-lose-lifetime-lease-five-year-review" title=""&gt;social housing stock is fast diminishing&lt;/a&gt;, buying a home is still an impossible dream for many and the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/23/generation-rent-locked-out-of-housing-market" title=""&gt;rental market is both viciously competitive&lt;/a&gt; and increasingly unaffordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures released today compound the already dismal picture for those living in the private rented sector. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/12/brighton-and-bristol-hit-hardest-as-rents-raised-by-an-average-of-18-in-2015" title=""&gt;Average rents across Britain went up by 4.9% in 2015&lt;/a&gt; – an increase far higher than most people saw in their pay packets. In some places the hikes in rent were particularly eyewatering. In Brighton &amp;amp; Hove – where my constituency is based – landlords raised rents by an average of 18% compared with 2014. These record rent level rises mean a typical flat in my home city now costs &amp;pound;1,078 a month and an average earner pays 65% of their salary for a typical two-bed flat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/private-tenants-living-rent-commision"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trapped in their self-referential Twitter bubble, journalists often fail to realise that social media doesn’t represent the whole world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Twitter’s status as &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/twitter-is-public-1543016594"&gt;a platform for public debate&lt;/a&gt; is a dog-whistle platitude that has become the gilded shield of First-Amendment-waving journalists everywhere, like our very own #NotAllMen hashtag, to justify the mishandling – and, in some cases, even endangerment – of our sources for digital stories (and, yes, tweets should be considered sources). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, anyone can stumble upon your unprotected tweet; therefore, we can embed your tweet in our news story without informing you or asking your permission.

      <title>Britain's Pompeii? Well, we can dream | David Shariatmadari</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/britains-pompeii-bronze-age</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may snort at the fact that a bronze-age village has been compared to the most famous Roman site in the world. But what we lack in grandeur we make up for in romanticism&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re calling it &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-35280290"&gt;Britain’s Pompeii&lt;/a&gt;, after the well-preserved Roman town in the heart of Italy. There, temple columns stand tall against the sky and it’s easy to squint and imagine that the crowds milling around are wearing togas and buying tickets to see someone get eaten by a lion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain’s Pompeii isn’t a Roman ruin, it’s a bronze-age one. But you still might be expecting something dramatic; standing stones, maybe, or a burial labyrinth. Actually, it’s quite a lot of wood, in a sort of bog. It looks like a wet weekend in East Anglia. It is. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/britains-pompeii-bronze-age"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I had to learn to love my dad again – once he sobered up | Ronnie Joice</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/learn-love-dad-alcohol-sobered-up</link>
      <description>I lost my father to alcohol, in every sense. We still live in fear for his future, but we finally have a relationship again&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t around to witness my dad’s rapid decline between 2005 and 2007, I would hear stories by the time it was too late to do anything about them, but my conscience finally crept up on me, and with news coming in that perhaps he might not make it beyond the next year, I went back home to visit him for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first time I’d seen him for two years. He’d been a functioning &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/alcoholism" title=""&gt;alcoholic&lt;/a&gt; all his life, but now he was unable to do anything but drink, and I was so, so nervous. I felt like I was meeting a ghost. I had convinced myself that he didn’t exist any more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/learn-love-dad-alcohol-sobered-up"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>March of the makers remains a figment of Osborne's imagination</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/march-of-the-makers-osbornes-economy-manufacturing-output</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Five years on from pledge to rebalance the economy, manufacturing output is no higher than in 2011, with sector officially back in recession&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Britain “carried aloft by the march of the makers”. That was the country George Osborne envisaged in the peroration to his &lt;a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2011/march/budget-2011-statement/"&gt;2011 budget speech&lt;/a&gt;. The message from the chancellor was clear; gone were the days when the economy relied on debt-fuelled spending. The clock was being turned back to the days when Britain actually made stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jan/12/oil-30-dollers-per-barrel-opec-mark-carney-business-live"&gt;Weak UK manufacturing data hits the pound - business live&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/march-of-the-makers-osbornes-economy-manufacturing-output"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley appeared more concerned with competing to spout buzzwords at Monday’s Brown &amp;amp; Black Forum than they did demonstrating true understanding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With young black voters &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/opinion/campaign-stops/the-missing-black-millennials.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share&amp;amp;referer=&amp;amp;_r=1"&gt;set to play a crucial role&lt;/a&gt; in deciding the election later this year, the three remaining Democratic presidential candidates faced questions on issues affecting marginalized communities at Fusion’s &lt;a href="http://fusion.net/video/254081/iowa-brown-black-presidential-forum-fusion-live/"&gt;Brown &amp;amp; Black Forum&lt;/a&gt; in Des Moines on Monday night, about two weeks before the Iowa caucuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/14/black-lives-matter-democratic-presidential-debate"&gt;significant past stumbles&lt;/a&gt; on related topics from each of the candidates as national tensions surrounding race have reached a peak, so the stakes were high for all three to prove that our concerns will be minded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/democratic-presidential-candidates-black-and-brown-forum-iowa-primary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Don’t blame modern dating apps for crimes. It’s people who commit them | Nell Frizzell</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/tinder-grindr-crimes-rise-dating-apps</link>
      <description>Yes, Tinder, Grindr and online sites have changed the sexual landscape, and vigilance about personal security is vital. But technology doesn’t inflict abuse – it’s still human beings who do that&lt;p&gt;Dating apps have changed the landscape of single life as irrevocably as an A-road through a moor. Arguably they brought the very act of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/online-dating" title=""&gt;dating&lt;/a&gt; – previously a particularly American pastime – to British shores. But as these apps get woven into the social and sexual fabric of Britain, so too have their involvement in incidents of sexual abuse, assault and violent crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent freedom of information request has revealed that &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12091971/Crimes-linked-to-Tinder-and-Grindr-increase-seven-fold.html" title=""&gt;crimes with a connection to dating apps&lt;/a&gt; increased sevenfold over the past two years; from 55 reports in 2013 to 412 in the year to October 2015. Those crimes include some of the most frightening: rape, sexual grooming and attempted murder. But dig under that statistic a little further, pick the scab to examine the wound underneath, and the picture is not quite so clear, nor blame quite so easy to apportion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/tinder-grindr-crimes-rise-dating-apps"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Cutting disabled people’s benefits will make it harder for them to find work | Colin Low</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/12/cutting-disabled-benefits-welfare-harder-work</link>
      <description>That’s why I’m lobbying against the proposed 30% cut in disability benefits for those deemed able to work - more employment, not further sanction is needed&lt;p&gt;The new welfare reform and work bill will be very damaging for disabled people. From April next year, new claimants of employment and support allowance (ESA) who are placed in the work-related activity group (which means they are deemed likely to be able to work in the future) face a 30% cut – nearly &amp;pound;30 a week – compared to what existing claimants receive today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cut is estimated to produce annual savings of &amp;pound;640m by 2020-21, but at the cost of further hardship to disabled people who are already poor and, by definition, unable to work. It’s hard enough for existing ESA recipients to get by on &amp;pound;5,300 a year, but for new claimants to have to survive on just &amp;pound;3,800 is devastating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/12/cutting-disabled-benefits-welfare-harder-work"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Yes we should teach our kids about money, but how exactly escapes me</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/12/teach-kids-about-money-pockey-money-savings</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pocket money, savings, ponies, Muppets and nails – it’s a minefield, especially when your audience is clueless, says Zoe Williams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m running a randomised controlled trial on pocket money with my own children: the oldest, eight, has the benefit of modern technology (more on this later), the youngest, six, relies on my remembering to pay her. In practice, this means the oldest gets &amp;pound;10 a month and the youngest gets nothing. After a period of accumulation the youngest vents her outrage and gets a lump sum. She immediately loses it. Our main hope is that she mislays it somewhere in the house where it can reenter the slipstream of the family’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My findings are as follows: miniature bank accounts are brilliant, but not necessarily educational. I use &lt;a href="https://osper.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Osper&lt;/a&gt;, which is an account for eight-pluses that comes with a card they can use in a cash machine or on the internet. I don’t know if you can stick it behind the bar because we haven’t tried it. I have a &amp;pound;10 monthly standing order and can add one-off amounts online. I can also invite other people to put money on it, which I never do, because it’s the financial equivalent of asking them to look at pictures of your child and wax lyrical about its cuteness. So far, Osper has taught the big ’un that money, with automating top-ups and nobody ever spending it, accumulates as effortlessly as wet leaves in a drain. It also taught him that getting money out of a cashpoint with his own pin is mind-bendingly exciting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/12/teach-kids-about-money-pockey-money-savings"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>After the floods, local government is fighting to stay afloat | Peter Hetherington</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/12/local-government-floods-fighting-stay-afloat</link>
      <description>Surface flooding may have caused more than 60% of the damage, yet street drainage maintenance by councils has been cut dramatically so even moderate rainfall turns roads into small rivers&lt;p&gt;The state is fast shrinking. Local government, as we’ve known it, is in danger of sinking. Public agencies make do and mend as best they can, starved of resources. They do the government’s bidding through gritted teeth, aware that ministers only come running when the country – or parts of it – is beset by &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/flooding" title=""&gt;a natural disaster&lt;/a&gt;, or another emergency. Then – remember &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2015/dec/07/david-cameron-carlisle-cumbria-flood-damage-storm-desmond-video" title=""&gt;David Cameron in flood-stricken Carlisle&lt;/a&gt; last month? – they promise to deliver “whatever it takes”. They quickly move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s often little, if any coordination between Whitehall and town halls – pooling resources and expertise to develop a national flood management plan, for instance – because the government has made clear it doesn’t like planning, which is apparently redolent of a top-down, over-mighty state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/12/local-government-floods-fighting-stay-afloat"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>North Korea's 'H-bomb' shouldn't stop us calling out human rights atrocities</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week’s nuke test proves the DPRK will do what it wants. So let’s not stay quiet for fear of upsetting the regime &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after it detonated its fourth nuclear test last week, North Korean state media issued a &lt;a href="http://korea-dpr.info/statementH.pdf"&gt;lengthy statement&lt;/a&gt; justifying the explosion they knew would rile the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief among its grievances for &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/jan/06/north-korea-major-announcement-artificial-earthquake-nuclear-test-site-live"&gt;setting off the “H-bomb” &lt;/a&gt; was a lengthy investigation &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/18/un-north-korea-answer-crimes-against-humanity"&gt;by the United Nations&lt;/a&gt; which accused the regime of grave, systemic human rights abuses against its own people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/north-koreas-h-bomb-shouldnt-stop-us-calling-out-human-rights-atrocities"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Let’s tap into Islam’s heritage of critical education to defeat extremism in schools</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/12/islam-education-extremism-schools-muslim-prevent</link>
      <description>There are more effective ways to protect Muslim pupils than the government’s Prevent strategy, says a Muslim educator&lt;p&gt;The policy response to the threat of radicalisation has focused on law, security and intelligence. As the problem spirals out of control, this one-dimensional response, which includes the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/06/east-london-muslims-prevent-strategy"&gt;government’s Prevent policy&lt;/a&gt; in schools, seems merely to be repeated more aggressively. Applying security and surveillance policy across society not only risks limiting civil liberties, but also isolating mainstream Muslims. This does not counter the manipulative interpretation of Islam being used by extremists to play upon grievances held by some Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/12/rules-extremism-teachers-pupils-spy-radicalisation-muslims-prevent"&gt;Rules to fight extremism ‘creating fear among teachers and pupils’&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/12/islam-education-extremism-schools-muslim-prevent"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Inequality is a problem schools alone can’t fix</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/12/inequality-schools-disadvantaged-pupils-tristram-hunt</link>
      <description>In the Tories’ austerity era a&amp;nbsp;new approach is needed to&amp;nbsp;ensure disadvantaged pupils&amp;nbsp;are not left behind&lt;p&gt;Lost beneath the waves of the terrible floods this Christmas was coverage of another startlingly depressing story. New &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/29/inequality-uk-rich-poor-2030-analysis"&gt;research from the Fabian Society&lt;/a&gt; revealed the prospect of significantly sharper inequality heading Britain’s way. And with cuts falling disproportionately on single parents, this means the number of children living in poverty &lt;a href="http://www.fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Greatest-Divide.pdf"&gt;will rise from [pdf]&lt;/a&gt; 2.5 million (19%) to 4.4 million (28%) by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of the Conservatives’ austerity agenda and accelerating socioeconomic trends means inequality remains the defining political issue of contemporary Britain. But since the general election, both the Labour frontbench and government ministers have been far too quiet on the subject.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/12/inequality-schools-disadvantaged-pupils-tristram-hunt"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Would you buy a used housing estate from David Cameron? | Dreda Say Mitchell</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/11/housing-estate-david-cameron-social-housing</link>
      <description>The prime minister promises to bulldoze the worst social housing. But if he wants to help the residents, there are better ways to do it&lt;p&gt;One of the things you’re warned to expect as you get older is the feeling that you’ve seen it all before. I certainly had a distinct sensation of deja vu when I read that &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/09/david-cameron-vows-to-blitz-poverty-by-demolishing-uks-worst-sink-estates" title=""&gt;David Cameron is committed to demolishing or refurbishing “sink” estates&lt;/a&gt;, those well-known lairs of rioters, gangstas and other criminals. Many of us who grew up on inner-city council estates and spent our childhoods visiting relatives on some of the most notorious examples of the genre will be thinking – this again? It sometimes seems that almost before the architects and builders had finished constructing these estates, they were back again, fixing their original mistakes. Walkways came down or were lit up, playgrounds built, gardens planted, security doors and entry phones installed. Some of the worst high-rise estates were demolished pretty much before they’d got their own postcodes. After &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/16/newsid_2514000/2514277.stm" title=""&gt;the Ronan Point gas explosion in 1968&lt;/a&gt;, some tower block residents were left more worried about lighting matches in their kitchens than criminals loitering in stairwells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many of these estates were improved, the social and economic environment of residents went into steady decline&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/11/housing-estate-david-cameron-social-housing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>David Cameron leads MPs in a charade of smoke and mirrors</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/11/david-cameron-leads-mps-in-a-charade-of-smoke-and-mirrors</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Appearance and reality rarely converge in Westminster but on Monday they were many miles apart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smoke and mirrors,” cried Stephen Doughty, the former shadow Foreign Office minister who resigned live on TV during last week’s PMQs, to cause maximum embarrassment to his leader. He might just as well have been talking about himself rather than cuts to police funding. “Smoke and mirrors,” exclaimed John Hayes, the junior Home Office minister, when answering a question about cybercrime. He, too, could as easily have been talking about himself. His overly theatrical delivery has long since lapsed into pure panto dame. Oh yes, it has! Oh no, it hasn’t!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appearance and reality frequently struggle to stay on nodding terms with each other in Westminster, but on Monday they were miles apart. It began with David Cameron heading off to north London to deliver a speech on life chances and social equality. Since he’d become prime minister, he declared, putting on his best caring face, he’d noticed there were rather more poor people in the country than he had been led to believe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/11/david-cameron-leads-mps-in-a-charade-of-smoke-and-mirrors"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>We know it's effective. So why is there opposition to the HPV vaccine ?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/jan/11/why-is-there-opposition-hpv-vaccine-cervical-cancer</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over 90% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV. But squeamishness about sex and unsupported safety fears are threatening vaccination programmes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human papillomavirus (HPV) has long haunted humankind; almost all sexually active adults carry some of HPV’s 170 strains. And although many of these are harmless, amongst the myriad mutants there are those &lt;a draggable="true" href="http://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/cancer.html"&gt;whose effects are anything but benign&lt;/a&gt;: subtypes 6 and 11 can lead to genital warts; subtypes 16 and 18 (amongst others) can lead to cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal and oral cancers. This is not some mere hypothetical risk – over 90% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV, a cancer &lt;a draggable="true" href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs380/en/"&gt;which claimed the lives of 270,000 women in 2012&lt;/a&gt; alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the HPV vaccine Gardasil is extraordinarily effective at preventing infection, being &lt;a href="http://patient.info/health/human-papillomavirus-hpv-immunisation"&gt;at least 99% effective against the four most odious subtypes&lt;/a&gt; (6,11,16,18) in young women. Yet despite this, it has been the subject of dogged opposition - in the US, vaccination rates &lt;a draggable="true" href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p0730-hpv.html"&gt;have stagnated far below the optimum levels for protection&lt;/a&gt;, while a number of legal challenges against the vaccine have been mounted across Europe. But why is this the case?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/jan/11/why-is-there-opposition-hpv-vaccine-cervical-cancer"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>BP to axe 1 in 5 North Sea jobs as oil giant cuts 4,000 staff worldwide</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/bp-job-cuts-low-oil-prices</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Energy giant blames persistently low Brent crude price for major reduction in exploration and production jobs but has no plans to close any UK oil rigs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP is cutting one in five jobs at its North Sea operations as the oil price threatens to fall below $30 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British oil and gas group is laying off 600 people in Scotland in a cost-cutting drive that will involve 4,000 employees axed worldwide. The redundancies are taking place against the backdrop of a slumping oil price, which has hit industry profits and forced producers to shelve projects around the world &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/oil-delays-idUSL5N0Z22WR20150617"&gt;worth hundreds of billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/bp-job-cuts-low-oil-prices"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Government tax adviser 'sorry' for banking role during Libor crisis</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/government-tax-adviser-angela-knight-apologises-mps-libor-rigging-crisis-role</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Angela Knight, former head of British Bankers’ Association, apologises to MPs and says she did her best ‘in face of a hurricane’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former head of the British Bankers’ Association has repeatedly told MPs she was sorry that she ended up at the lobby group at the time of banking crisis and the Libor rigging scandal. Angela Knight, the former Conservative MP who &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/02/angela-knight-british-bankers-association"&gt;ran the BBA between 2007 and 2012&lt;/a&gt;, faced questions on Tuesday from the Treasury select committee about whether her tenure at the association was a credibility issue for her. She disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MPs on the committee were taking evidence about her appointment as chair of the Office of Tax Simplification after a two-year stint at Energy UK. “I found myself in charge [at the BBA] at the time of the biggest banking crisis in history. I did what I could in the face of a hurricane,” she said. “If someone who does a difficult job and finds themselves in a very tricky position does what they can, is thereafter told, ‘You can’t do anything else,’ you’ll never get anybody to do a difficult job again. I tried my best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/government-tax-adviser-angela-knight-apologises-mps-libor-rigging-crisis-role"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sir Terry Farrell, who worked on original masterplan for area, says final proposal is ‘too piecemeal and opportunistic’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When you submit a planning application for a big new building you can expect a few letters of objection from annoyed residents – but not perhaps a detailed condemnation of your plan from one of Britain’s most celebrated architects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is what has happened to the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/dec/31/the-paddington-shard-row-shines-a-light-on-londons-mayoral-choice"&gt;Paddington Place scheme&lt;/a&gt; – a huge development around the eponymous London station intended to include a 72-storey tower designed by Renzo Piano, the Italian architect who created the Shard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jan/12/terry-farrell-top-uk-architect-condemns-renzo-piano-paddington-development-plans"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Corbyn plan for Labour members to get say on Trident 'against rules'</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Party official says policymaking changes need conference’s agreement as union boss vows to fight for continued backing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Corbyn’s hopes of reversing &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;’s backing for &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident"&gt;Trident&lt;/a&gt; this spring have suffered a setback, after the party’s general secretary made clear there could be no change to its policymaking process before September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iain McNicol, Labour’s most senior official, told MPs at a parliamentary meeting that any changes to the way policy was made had to be agreed at the party’s autumn conference. His comments are a blow to suggestions that &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/11/labour-party-members-may-get-say-on-trident-policy-jeremy-corbyn"&gt;Labour’s membership could play a role in policy formation&lt;/a&gt; in advance of a crucial vote on replacing Trident nuclear submarines, which is expected before June.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/11/corbyn-plan-for-labour-members-to-get-say-on-trident-policy-against-rules"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of extremists break away from anti-refugee Pegida rally to smash windows and set fires in leftwing area of city&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 200 rightwing rioters have been arrested after going on an anti-immigrant rampage around the eastern city of Leipzig, erecting barricades and setting a building on fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The riot comes in a highly charged atmosphere after a series of sexual assaults on women by gangs of young migrant men on New Year’s Eve in Cologne and other towns, which hardened German public opinion towards Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open-door refugee policy. Sporadic attacks on women attributed to migrants were also reported in Austria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/german-police-arrest-211-after-far-right-riot-in-leipzig"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Commissioners to discuss response to rightwing government’s measures hitting press freedom and supreme court, though heavy sanctions are unlikely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poland’s nationalist government is on a collision course with the EU executive over its commitment to democracy and the rule of law less than two months after taking office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, the European commission will raise the pressure on Warsaw by debating how to respond to controversial new laws that have given the Polish government more control over the media, purged public broadcasting staff, and packed the supreme court with loyalists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/european-commission-to-debate-polands-controversial-new-laws"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistani paramilitary force raids home of New York Times correspondent</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/pakistani-paramilitary-force-raids-home-new-york-times-correspondent</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interior ministry said raid on correspondent Salman Masood’s home by Rangers force was ‘in no way reasonable’, but did not elaborate why&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pakistani paramilitary force raided the home of the New York Times’ national correspondent on Tuesday in what officials called a routine search operation for a terrorism suspect. The search at the Islamabad home of Salman Masood came more than two years after &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/10/pakistan-new-york-times-declan-walsh"&gt;Pakistan expelled the Times’ bureau chief, Declan Walsh,&lt;/a&gt; during national elections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from the paramilitary Rangers force arrived at Masood’s house at around 7.30am (0230 GMT), he said, adding that the officers said they needed to search the home for a “terror suspect.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/pakistani-paramilitary-force-raids-home-new-york-times-correspondent"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A popular Polish weekly news magazine has depicted EU leaders including Angela Merkel wearing Nazi uniforms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relations between Brussels and Poland’s hardline Eurosceptic government have deteriorated further after a Polish magazine published a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=wprost&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;cover portraying five leading EU politicians&lt;/a&gt; – including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel – in Nazi uniforms beneath the headline These people want to control Poland again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The photoshopped image on the front of popular weekly Wprost showed Merkel, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, European parliament president Martin Schulz, EU commissioner G&amp;uuml;nther Oettinger, and Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, leaning over a map, echoing wartime photographs of Adolf Hitler and his generals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/polish-press-nazi-imagery-war-of-words-eu-angela-merkel"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Halle Freyssinet is an ambitious €200m project city officials hope will attract 1,000 French and foreign tech entrepreneurs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a corner of a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_arrondissement_of_Paris"&gt;previously rundown district &lt;/a&gt;in south-east Paris, hundreds of workers are tackling the challenge of turning a listed railway goods yard into an ultra-modern global hub for internet development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://1000startups.fr/"&gt;Halle Freyssinet&lt;/a&gt; is an ambitious €200m (&amp;pound;150m) development that city officials hope will become the world’s biggest startup incubator and attract about 1,000 French and foreign technology entrepreneurs. It is by far the biggest and most visually impressive of a series of projects that the Socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo, hopes will put Paris on the international technology map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/paris-plans-worlds-largest-startup-incubator-in-former-railway-yard"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tunisian Mohammed Ali Malek one of just 28 survivors after boat he allegedly comanded collided with another ship leaving up to 800 people dead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal trial of a man accused of being the captain of a migrant ship that capsized last year, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/20/italy-pm-matteo-renzi-migrant-shipwreck-crisis-srebrenica-massacre"&gt;killing up to 800 people&lt;/a&gt;, is due to begin today in the Sicilian city of Catania, in what officials say is an attempt to pursue justice for victims of one of the worst maritime tragedies in the Mediterranean in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Tunisian named Mohammed Ali Malek, who was &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/21/survivors-800-migrant-boat-disaster-reach-italy-catania"&gt;27 years-old at the time of his arrest,&lt;/a&gt; was among just 28 survivors who were rescued after the overloaded fishing boat, which he allegedly commanded, capsized shortly before midnight on 18 April 2015. Although the precise number of victims is unknown, it is believed that more than 700 people – mostly African and Bangladeshi migrants who were locked in the ship’s hull – were killed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/man-accused-of-being-captain-of-capsized-migrant-ship-on-trial-in-italy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Survey co-authored by Trae Vassallo, who testified in the Ellen Pao case, found that for women in tech and venture capital gender discrimination is common&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty percent of the women working in Silicon Valley experience unwanted sexual advances, according to a new survey released this week. About two-thirds of them say that these advances were from their superior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey called &lt;a href="http://elephantinthevalley.com/"&gt;Elephant in the Valley&lt;/a&gt; was conducted by seven women, one of whom was a key witness in the Ellen Pao trial last year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/12/silicon-valley-women-harassment-gender-discrimination"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Asylum seekers resist attempts by French government to move them from makeshift settlement to new ‘prison-like’ facility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents at the informal refugee camps at Calais say they will peacefully resist attempts to bulldoze parts of their makeshift settlement, after French police gave about a third of them until Thursday to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police have announced that they will destroy the homes of an estimated 1,600 people at the Calais camp, known as the “Jungle”, which is used by up to 5,000 asylum seekers as a base from which they attempt to enter Britain via the Channel tunnel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/calais-jungle-residents-defy-bulldozers-police-ultimatum"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Putin hints that Russia could grant asylum to Assad</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/putin-russia-assad-asylum-snowden</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Russian president says it was more difficult to shelter whistleblower Edward Snowden than it would be to welcome Syrian leader. &lt;a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/putin-says-russia-could-grant-syrian-president-assad-asylum/27482589.html"&gt;RFE/RL reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia could grant asylum to Bashar al-Assad if he is forced to leave Syria, Vladimir Putin suggested in an interview with the German tabloid Bild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russian president said it was premature to discuss asylum, but added that it would be easier to welcome the Syrian leader than the US whistleblower Edward Snowden, who was &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/01/edward-snowden-asylum-russia-nsa"&gt;given asylum in Russia in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/putin-russia-assad-asylum-snowden"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>World Bank cancels funding for Uganda road amid sexual assault claims</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/12/world-bank-cancels-uganda-road-sexual-assault-claims</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bank pulls plug on $265m transport scheme after allegations that construction workers targeted schoolgirls and reports of poor treatment of workers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christine Baryamuzura is at her wit’s end. As the local council secretary for women in Bukonderwa, a village in the Ugandan district of Kamwenge, she has left no stone unturned in her efforts to get something done about the construction work that, she says, has destroyed lives in her community. A seemingly interminable cycle of emails and meetings has changed nothing. Claims that girls have been sexually abused remain uninvestigated. Meanwhile, homes, health and livelihoods are in a state of steady deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the heart of it all is a road project, supported by the World Bank, that should have helped rather than harmed the community. “That’s the tragedy that has come to this village,” Baryamuzura said. “Everything has been destroyed: our gardens, our homes, even our girls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/12/world-bank-cancels-uganda-road-sexual-assault-claims"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A lightbulb moment for the old-fashioned filament</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/jan/12/lightbulb-filament-incandescent-back-efficient-energy-saving</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you yearn for the soft, instant light of the incandescent bulb? Edison’s invention could be back – in an even more efficient form than energy-saving fluorescents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a metaphor, the “lightbulb moment” doesn’t work so well now that we have to wait five minutes for a low-energy bulb to get going. But a group of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have had a bit of a lightbulb moment. The fondly remembered, but extremely inefficient, old-fashioned tungsten bulb could soon be &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35284112"&gt;modified to reuse its wasted energy&lt;/a&gt;. This would make it even more efficient than the new types of energy-saving LED and compact fluorescent bulbs to which we’ve switched in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all the energy used by old filament bulbs is converted to heat, with only around 5% given off as light. In their paper, poetically entitled “resurrection of the incandescent source”, the MIT team describe how infrared radiation, which would otherwise be wasted, can be reflected and reabsorbed through a structure of up to 300 layers around the filament, using nanotechnology. “It is not so much the material you make the surrounding structure from, it is how you arrange the material to create the optical filtering property that will recycle infrared light and let the visible light through,” said Ognjen Ilic, from MIT’s research laboratory of electronics. This research could lead, one day, to the introduction of a high-tech lightbulb with an old-world glow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/jan/12/lightbulb-filament-incandescent-back-efficient-energy-saving"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>David Cameron sees red as the liaison committee bares its teeth</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/12/david-cameron-sees-red-as-the-liaison-committee-bares-its-teeth</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Realising Labour is too busy infighting to hold the government to call, Tory Andrew Tyrie mounted a one-man opposition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The face had gone way past red. David Cameron had started by scribbling “I hate Julian” in his folder. Then he crossed out Julian’s name and wrote Harriet’s instead. Harriet’s name was the next to go, to be replaced with ANDREW spelled out in capitals and underlined heavily. This was getting him nowhere, so he started to bang his finger heavily on the desk in frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, too, got him nowhere. Finally, he snapped. “If you think that, then you don’t know what you’re talking about,” Dave said, holding up the palm of his hand to Andrew Tyrie, the liaison committee’s chair. Speak to the hand, Andrew. It was the closest any of us are likely to get to seeing the prime minister lose his temper in public. Several members of the committee smirked. Job done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/12/david-cameron-sees-red-as-the-liaison-committee-bares-its-teeth"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Apple promises a good night's sleep with new iPhone feature</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/12/apple-good-sleep-new-iphone-feature-night-shift</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;‘Night Shift’ makes screen of mobile device redder at night, following research that suggests it can help with sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not often that a smaller update of iOS, Apple’s operating system for mobile devices, comes with treats for users. But the forthcoming iOS 9.3, which has just been released in beta form to developers, comes with one big feature: a good night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s thanks to a new feature called Night Shift, which adjusts the colour balance of the iPad or iPhone’s screen after sunset. The phone uses geolocation and its internal clock to tell when it’s sundown, and then shifts the colours onscreen so they’re warmer, with more orange and red tones and fewer blue and white.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/12/apple-good-sleep-new-iphone-feature-night-shift"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Richard Ayoade takes his desert-dry snark to France; Derren Brown investigates social compliance; Brian Cox and Dara Ó Briain interview Tim Peake. Plus: fifth series of Ruth Jones’s comedy-drama&lt;p&gt;Richard Ayoade takes his desert-dry snark to France, staying at l’Hotel, the opulent site of Oscar Wilde’s death. Leaving that shrine to Left Bank literary chic, he heads for the Montparnasse tower to look at the Eiffel tower, before going on a scooter tour, eating calf’s head casserole, drinking absinthe and learning about cordon bleu cookery, fine art and bespoke perfume. Trying not to simply stand there helpless with laughter as Ayoade relentlessly undermines his own enterprise is this week’s companion, Mel Giedroyc. &lt;em&gt;Jack Seale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/12/tuesdays-best-tv-travel-man-48-hours-in-paris-derren-brown-pushed-to-the-edge-stargazing-live-stella"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>New trailer for Coen brothers comedy Hail, Caesar! gets complicated</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/12/new-trailer-coen-brothers-comedy-hail-caesar-ralph-fiennes</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ralph Fiennes looks set to continue his run of sharp comic performances with a role as a demanding director in this 1950s-set Hollywood farce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narrowly avoiding awards season and landing in the middle of a glut of less exciting propositions, the latest Coen brothers comedy has a somewhat concerning February bow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/oct/09/george-clooney-scarlet-johansson-coen-brothers-hail-ceasar"&gt;Could Hail, Caesar! be the most Coen-y Coen brothers film yet?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/12/new-trailer-coen-brothers-comedy-hail-caesar-ralph-fiennes"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How to survive SoulCycle: the fitness-meets-therapy class getting celebrities in a spin</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/jan/12/soulcycle-fitness-therapy-class-celebrities-spin-us-london</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The motivational indoor cycling workout is huge in the US – the Obamas, Clintons and Beckhams are all fans. With classes expected to launch in London soon, here’s what you should know &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One by one, I have watched my friends succumb to the sweaty grasp of SoulCycle: a fitness phenomenon that has been &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/13/soulcycle-therapy-cult-tom-cruise-lady-gaga-comes-to-london"&gt;compared to a cult&lt;/a&gt;. The indoor cycling chain launched in New York in 2006; in the intervening decade it has grown exponentially, gone public and spawned a devoted, influential following. Michelle Obama &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/11/us/politics/a-beat-and-a-bike-michelle-obamas-candlelit-habit.html"&gt;recently revealed that she is a fan&lt;/a&gt;. So is Hillary Clinton; indeed, Chelsea Clinton recently held a &lt;a href="http://time.com/4166337/chelsea-clinton-soulcycle-fundraiser-new-york/"&gt;SoulCycle election fundraiser for her mum&lt;/a&gt;. Other high-profile devotees include Oprah, Lady Gaga, Lena Dunham and the Beckhams, and it has been &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSexyQeD_vA"&gt;parodied everywhere from Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/highlight/55ca457578c90ad1b500052d"&gt;Mistress America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibility of having a celeb sweating it out on a bike next to you is one reason why people are prepared to pay $34 (&amp;pound;24) for a 45-minute SoulCycle class. This is a lot to spend on pedalling a stationary bike in the dark. But, according to SoulCycle’s devotees, the class’s combination of therapy and fitness is just so, so worth it. “You dance on a bike with all these beautiful people around you,” a friend raves. “And gorgeous instructors tell you inspirational messages about how you just need to be you because you are good enough.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/jan/12/soulcycle-fitness-therapy-class-celebrities-spin-us-london"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Top 10 family hotels and campsites in Europe</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jan/12/top-10-family-hotel-villa-holiday-accommodation-europe</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;These small hotels and campsites, all set in gorgeous locations, strike just the right balance between being child-friendly and appealing to parents who don’t want to feel like they are holidaying in a giant creche &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lanzarote is a brilliant destination for young kids, with attractions aplenty and funky towns set into beautiful deserty scenery that will satisfy parents’ lust for the exotic, all within a four-hour flight. It’s easy to drive around exploring otherworldly landscapes, epic beaches, seawater swimming pools, the volcanic &lt;a href="http://www.discoverlanzarote.com/timanfaya.asp"&gt;Timanfaya national park&lt;/a&gt;, C&amp;eacute;sar Manrique’s incredible Bond villain homes and his underground caves development Jameos del Agua, with cafe, gardens, pools and auditorium. And there are dozens of easy places to eat – early. One fab place to stay is Casa Tomaren, handily in the centre of the island, consisting of eight villas around a tropical sunken garden with pool and astro turf. The big buffet breakfasts feature cakes, eggs to order and particularly delicious croissants. Its grounds have plenty to interest toddlers – buddha statues, roaming cats and cacti – and massages and yoga are available. The only hitch is the lack of baths, which may cause tears if your tot is a shower-refusenik. &lt;br /&gt;•&lt;em&gt; Studio villa (sleeps 2) from €113 a night, 2-bedroom villa (sleeps 4) €236, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://tomaren.es"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tomaren.es&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Or try Lanzarote Retreats’ fab eco-friendly, self-catering hideaways on the beach at Arrieta, with a choice of cottages, yurts and villas. Travel cots or foldingbeds and baby/toddler equipment are supplied, there’s a solar-heated pool and kids’ play area, and they can help collect eggs. One week from €700, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://lanzaroteretreats.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;lanzaroteretreats.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jan/12/top-10-family-hotel-villa-holiday-accommodation-europe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Creed: how to get the Rocky workout look</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/12/creed-rocky-spinoff-classic-workout-grey-marl-sweatshirt</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest instalment of the boxing saga hits cinemas this week, offering a timely reminder of the enduring appeal of grey marl&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rocky spinoff is in cinemas on Friday, meaning that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgSMxY6asoE"&gt;Eye of the Tiger&lt;/a&gt; blasted out beyond the headphones for your 5K run is positively zeitgeisty. But what to wear to keep in with the theme? Forget any new-fangled ideas like &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/08/athevening-how-to-wear-jogging-bottoms-to-the-pub"&gt;athevening&lt;/a&gt; and go classic. A grey marl sweatshirt, preferably with the sleeves lopped off, is veteran champion-workout wear this January. It is the icon of Rocky chic – a sub-genre of sportswear celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/12/creed-rocky-spinoff-classic-workout-grey-marl-sweatshirt"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>EastEnders: At last, a wedding with a happy ending</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/12/eastenders-wedding-world-of-lather</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a traditionally miserable Christmas a proper tear-jerking soapy surprise was just the ticket in Albert Square&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a new year, it’s a new start. Everything’s going to be cushty.” With those words, lovely jubbly &lt;strong&gt;EastEnders&lt;/strong&gt; landlord Mick Carter jinxed his long-awaited wedding day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big wedding is just what EastEnders was crying out for after a traditionally miserable Christmas. Ronnie accidentally had Fatboy killed off in a car boot, evil Dean attacked Roxy, and even Kat’s comeback couldn’t lighten the mood. “’Appy Christmas, you old slapper!” she cried at a struggling Stacey. Where Kat leads, Alfie follows: he bumbled in pretending to be OK, despite being on the run from the doctors who want to examine his brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/12/eastenders-wedding-world-of-lather"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Judges hail daring use of form in a collection that examines poet’s joint British and Chinese heritage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new voice, who judges say “will change British poetry”, has won the TS Eliot poetry prize. &lt;a href="http://sarahhowepoetry.com/"&gt;Sarah Howe&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow at Harvard University’s Radcliffe Institute, was awarded the &amp;pound;20,000 prize for &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jun/18/emma-lee-moss-how-books-took-me-on-a-journey-back-to-china"&gt;Loop of Jade&lt;/a&gt;, which explores her dual British and Chinese heritage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howe’s work – the first debut poetry collection to win the British prize since it was inaugurated in 1993 – triumphed over a particularly strong shortlist, which featured some of poetry’s biggest names, including &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/27/poetry-book-of-the-month-40-sonnets-don-paterson"&gt;Don Paterson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/29/poet-claudia-rankine-invisibility-black-women-everyday-racism-citizen"&gt;Claudia Rankine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/seanobrien"&gt;Sean O’Brien&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/22/les-murray-poet-life-profile"&gt; Les Murray&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/11/ts-eliot-prize-poet-sarah-howe-wins-with-amazing-debut"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Deadwood: what to watch until the movie rides into town</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HBO has confirmed that series creator David Milch will be making a new film of the wild west drama that was cancelled in 2006. Here are five shows to watch while you wait&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After almost a decade of industry tittle-tattle, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/14/deadwood-is-the-best-drama-hbo-has-ever-made-it-must-be-revived"&gt;fan speculation&lt;/a&gt; and hopeful &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/garretdillahunt/status/631641439852699649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;tweets from former cast members&lt;/a&gt;, HBO has finally addressed the Olyphant in the room. Last week, the network confirmed that &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/14/deadwood-is-the-best-drama-hbo-has-ever-made-it-must-be-revived"&gt;Deadwood&lt;/a&gt; – David Milch’s peerless, profane exploration of frontier psychology in gold-rush South Dakota – would belatedly &lt;a href="http://tvline.com/2016/01/07/deadwood-movie-reunion-hbo-premiere-date/"&gt;return in the form of a movie&lt;/a&gt; tying up all the loose ends left over after its abrupt cancellation in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reported by &lt;a href="http://tvline.com/2016/01/07/deadwood-movie-reunion-hbo-premiere-date/"&gt;TVLine&lt;/a&gt;, HBO programming president Michael Lombardo said that he had given series creator Milch the go-ahead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/11/deadwood-movie-film-what-to-watch-five-tv-shows"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>T-shirt folding is the new shopping – bring on Marie Kondo’s decluttering revolution</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/11/marie-kondo-spark-joy-decluttering-revolution</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Retail therapy may have lost its lustre, but Kondo’s ‘spark joy’ message promises to cleanse your wardrobe and your soul as well&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shopping is over, and tidying up is hot. A drawer in which a spare, thoughtfully chosen, selection of socks stand to attention like little soldiers is as much an of-the-moment status symbol as Paris Hilton laden down with ribbon-tied Fred Segal packages was in the 00s. If you want to nail this season, it’s not about spending &amp;pound;320 on the &lt;a href="http://www.matchesfashion.com/products/Givenchy-I-Feel-Love-oversized-T-shirt-1036475" title=""&gt;Givenchy I Feel Love T-shirt&lt;/a&gt; you saw on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/93zcUIRbES/" title=""&gt;Brooklyn Beckham’s Instagram. &lt;/a&gt;No, it’s about spending half a day ridding yourself of any T-shirts that don’t “spark joy” – in the buzzphrase of decluttering guru Marie Kondo – and then the rest of the day folding the ones that do into perfect rectangles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/361757/" title=""&gt;Kondo’s “Spark Joy” revolution&lt;/a&gt;, with its aim of making neat-freaks of us all by encouraging us to throw away any belongings that no longer bring us happiness, has gained traction where a million New Year resolutions have failed by rebranding a chore as millennial me-time. Shopping is supposed to be me-time, too – remember when we called it retail therapy? – but it has lost some of its lustre, thanks to our overindulgence. Perhaps now that we click and buy from Amazon via our phone while waiting for the kettle to boil, shopping doesn’t feel like so much of a treat any more. This year, we spent &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35178207" title=""&gt;an estimated &amp;pound;728m&lt;/a&gt; online shopping &lt;em&gt;on Christmas Day&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/11/marie-kondo-spark-joy-decluttering-revolution"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I Am Van Dyck review – the Andy Warhol of 17th-century portraiture</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/12/i-am-van-dyck-review-dulwich-picture-gallery-london</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dulwich Picture Gallery, London&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The surfaces of Van Dyck’s paintings are all glitter, but the stories they tell are often shockingly morbid&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would it be like if the ghost of a famous artist came back to see his paintings, flitting among the 21st century gallery crowds with his &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/aug/05/art"&gt;Laughing Cavalier&lt;/a&gt; moustache? That’s what happens in &lt;a href="http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk%29/"&gt;I Am Van Dyck&lt;/a&gt; at Dulwich Picture Gallery. While people queue for the gallery’s hit MC Escher exhibition, the 17th century master Anthony van Dyck, back from the dead, gazes past them at the gallery’s collection of some of his most memorable paintings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/12/i-am-van-dyck-review-dulwich-picture-gallery-london"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>'Help, we're sinking': aboard a refugee rescue boat in the perilous Greek seas</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/refugee-rescues-continue-winter-greece-agathonisi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ten times as many refugees have arrived in Europe by boat so far this month as in the whole of last January. &lt;strong&gt;Patrick Kingsley&lt;/strong&gt; talks to some of the arrivals on the Greek island of Agathonisi and observes the rescue of a sinking dinghy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardian.charitiestrust.org/guardianappeal.aspx"&gt;Migrant Offshore Aid Station is one of the beneficiaries of the Guardian’s annual charity appeal. Find out how you can help here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Help,” shouts Ahmed, a Syrian doctor. He stands up in his inflatable dinghy, surrounded by 39 other refugees, and calls out to an approaching rescue boat. “We are sinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few metres away, bursting from the dark cockpit of the orange rescue launch, captain John Hamilton at first hopes that Ahmed is exaggerating. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/refugee-rescues-continue-winter-greece-agathonisi"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>El Chapo, Hollywood and the lure of the mob movie</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/12/el-chapo-joaquin-gatman-hollywood-lure-of-movies-sean-penn</link>
      <description>From Al ‘Scarface’ Capone to the recently captured Joaquín Gatmán, gangsters have always looked to cinema to boost their image&lt;p&gt;News of the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/10/did-sean-penn-inadvertently-have-a-hand-in-el-chapos-capture"&gt;meeting between Sean Penn and the Sinaloa cartel chief Joaqu&amp;iacute;n “El Chapo” Guzm&amp;aacute;n&lt;/a&gt; came as no surprise to anyone familiar with the psychology of organised crime bosses. Of course Guzm&amp;aacute;n wanted to make a film about himself. As I pointed out in &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/12/crime.mafia"&gt;my book Gomorrah&lt;/a&gt;, and we subsequently showed in &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/10/crime"&gt;the film&lt;/a&gt;, we tend to think that cinema observes the criminal underworld; in fact, it’s quite the opposite: the criminal world watches movies. The bosses are aware that a lot of the best cinema and TV focuses on crime, which makes them keen to be involved in the production. That way, they will be able to skew the portrayal of them in their favour. They, and their followers, need films to show their heroism, their victories over authority. Criminal organisations, from Mexico to Italy, have always looked to cinema to tell their stories, to give them inspiration or to take inspiration from them, heroes to imitate, codes to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/10/did-sean-penn-inadvertently-have-a-hand-in-el-chapos-capture"&gt;Did Sean Penn inadvertently have a hand in El Chapo's recapture?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/12/el-chapo-joaquin-gatman-hollywood-lure-of-movies-sean-penn"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The refugee who took on the British government | Ben Rawlence</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/ethiopian-refugee-who-took-on-the-british-government</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For British politicians, foreign aid to Africa has become a cherished emblem of our idealism and generosity. But what happens when our funds harm those they are meant to help? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day in late 2010, a farmer – I will call him Opik – woke up in his village in the remote Ethiopian province of Gambella. In this lush lowland area of savanna bordering &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/south-sudan"&gt;South Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, the semi-nomadic Anuak people have lived for centuries, cultivating sorghum and maize, swimming in the river and gathering nuts, berries and fruits from the trees and wild honey from the forest. “It was paradise,” Opik recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anuak have an intimate relationship with their landscape. Their highest traditional authority is a spiritual leader called the &lt;em&gt;wat-ngomi&lt;/em&gt;, who must sanction any human intervention in nature. Some trees are deemed sacred and cannot be cut down. Spirits live in certain sites and even the boundaries of their territory are inscribed with religious meaning. Everyone knows where the land of one community ends and that of another begins. This intimacy is reflected in their language: “How are you?” in the Anuak language is &lt;em&gt;piny bede nidi&lt;/em&gt;, which literally translates as “how is the earth?” The reply is &lt;em&gt;piny ber jak&lt;/em&gt; (“the earth is fine”) or &lt;em&gt;piny rac&lt;/em&gt; (“the earth is bad”).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/12/ethiopian-refugee-who-took-on-the-british-government"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Gentrification X: how an academic argument became the people's protest</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jan/12/gentrification-argument-protest-backlash-urban-generation-displacement</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the first of a special series on the impact of gentrification on cities around the world, Dan Hancox meets victims and beneficiaries of this highly emotive issue – and finds that the anger is real, and resistance is coming to a head&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Amal had stopped crying, she apologised. “I wake up so sick, you know? I have to go to study but I feel so sick.” A victim of domestic violence and now a single mother, she lives with her three young children in grimy temporary accommodation in Tooting, south London. She was telling me that Wandsworth council, which has a legal obligation to house the family, tried sending them to a rented flat on the outskirts of Newcastle, then suggested West Bromwich. She’d never heard of either place. “I said to them, ‘I already told you, I have a job interview in London, I am studying in London, my children are at school in London, my ex-husband visits every week to help with the children.’”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Bromwich, the council insisted, was her last chance. Otherwise she would be declared “intentionally homeless”, and be put out with her young children on the street. “They said, ‘just one option: West Bromwich.’ If I said no, they wouldn’t give me another chance.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jan/12/gentrification-argument-protest-backlash-urban-generation-displacement"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why going part-time is more than just a feminist issue</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/12/part-time-feminist-job-women-flexibility</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New research shows that 1.5 million part-time workers are over-qualified for their jobs, with women worst affected. For people whose families preclude working more hours, there needs to be greater workplace flexibility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember the first interview I&amp;nbsp;did about the gender pay gap, back in the 90s, when women had their very own Equal Opportunities Commission. We talked about pay rates reaching parity in full-time work, then getting dragged down by part-time work, which was chiefly undertaken by women and always paid less. Being pre-children and doing a job that was essentially leisure (drinking) anyway, I blankly didn’t see part-time work as a feminist issue, any more than expensive stable costs would be feminist if women were the predominant horse owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://timewise.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/JRF_Flexible_Hiring_Research_Summary.pdf" title=""&gt;New data from Timewise&lt;/a&gt;, a lobby group for flexible working, and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation highlights how much the culture of the part-time world costs. It defines “quality” jobs as those that pay more than &amp;pound;20,000 a year, and excludes from the category “flexible” zero-hours contracts and freelance work – basically, those jobs in which all the flexibility is in the employer’s favour. It is plain that part-time work is not just a feminist issue, but a poverty issue, a skills issue, a political issue – encapsulating the skewed power balance between capital and labour – and, at the risk of sounding new-agey, a self-worth issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/12/part-time-feminist-job-women-flexibility"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Poverty and pebble-dash on Rochdale 'sink estate' – but is bulldozing the answer?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/11/rochdale-falinge-estate-demolition-council-housing</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Falinge estate is one of England’s most deprived neighbourhoods, but its community is divided over whether wholesale demolition would be a good idea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Welcome to Falinge,” says the faded sign outside the Rochdale neighbourhood formerly known as England’s most deprived housing estate. A warren of pebble-dashed three-storey flats, Lower Falinge is home to about 1,000 people, the vast majority of them on the breadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/household-income/poverty-and-social-exclusion-in-the-uk-and-eu/2005-2011/rpt--poverty-and-social-exclusion.html"&gt;government figures&lt;/a&gt; officially identified Falinge estate as the most deprived area in England – a mantle it had held for five consecutive years. The 2013 statistics were stark: 72% of people living on the estate were unemployed, while four out of five children were growing up in poverty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/11/rochdale-falinge-estate-demolition-council-housing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Chairlift: ‘You have to be honest with where your inspiration’s coming from’</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/12/indie-band-chairlift</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;They were a striving indie band until their song Bruises appeared, first on an Apple ad and then everywhere. How do you escape the shadow of a hit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspiration lurks in the strangest places. Just ask New York duo Chairlift, who owe much of their new record to the sight of a gorilla-chested Sean Connery leaping around an Irish hillside in a red mankini. This was the scene that played out night after night in the duo’s South Williamsburg studio as they made their third album Moth while watching the grizzled Scot’s obscure 1974 caper Zardoz, found in a petrol station bargain bin, in which the former James Bond is chased by warring survivors and savages in a colourful, post-apocalypse world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/10/ramona-lisa-arcadia-review"&gt;Ramona Lisa: Arcadia review – beguiling side-project from Chairlift singer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/12/indie-band-chairlift"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why are women with brain tumours being dismissed as attention-seekers?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2016/jan/11/women-brain-tumour-medical-symptoms-depression-diagnosis-gender</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Women with serious medical conditions are more likely than men to have their symptoms attributed to depression and anxiety, and face delayed diagnosis according to new research. It’s time to end the gender disparity in diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, the Brain Tumour Charity reported that &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/11/women-low-income-patients-delays-brain-tumour-diagnosis"&gt;women with brain tumours are being dismissed as attention-seekers&lt;/a&gt; or told they are just tired – only getting a diagnosis after several trips to the doctor. This delay can be catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is perhaps unsurprising. Historically, women’s health has been viewed with a “bikini approach”, the primary focus being breasts and the reproductive system. Cardiologist Nanette K Wenger notes that heart disease, for example, &lt;a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/109/5/558.full"&gt;is perceived as a man’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. A 1960s conference hosted by the American Heart Association in Oregon on women and cardiovascular disease was entitled: “How Can I Help My Husband Cope with Heart Disease?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2016/jan/11/women-brain-tumour-medical-symptoms-depression-diagnosis-gender"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Hidden Bodies by Caroline Kepnes review – the killer who plays it by the book</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/12/hidden-bodies-caroline-kepnes-review-joe-goldberg</link>
      <description>Psychotic bibliophile Joe Goldberg returns in this carnal follow-up to You&lt;p&gt;Booksellers have assumed starring roles in novels before. Few, however, have been quite as unusual – quite as psychotic – as Caroline Kepnes’s creation, Joe Goldberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldberg was last seen in Kepnes’s original and excellent debut, &lt;a href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/you-11.html" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which he fell for a customer, leaving a clutch of bodies along the way as he relentlessly stalked her into going out with him. &lt;em&gt;Hidden Bodies&lt;/em&gt; opens with Joe having seemingly put the past, and his “tragically ill girlfriend Guinevere Beck”, behind him. He’s in a new relationship, with Amy, and Kepnes’s narrator, as scathing and charismatic as ever, is still working in Mooney Rare and Used Books in New York. So is Amy, and they are, wonderfully pretentiously, collecting copies of &lt;em&gt;Portnoy’s Complaint&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/12/hidden-bodies-caroline-kepnes-review-joe-goldberg"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Anita Loos – sharp, shameless humour of the 'world's most brilliant woman'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/11/anita-loos-gentlemen-prefer-blondes-screenwriter-silent-era-films</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The writer of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was an extraordinary, barbed genius of the silent era, Hollywood and Broadway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anita Loos, the screenwriter and author, claimed – in typically waggish style – to be furious at the women’s lib movement. “They keep getting up on soapboxes and proclaiming that women are brighter than men,” she said. “That’s true, but it should be kept very quiet or it ruins the whole racket.” Loos was a veteran of silent-era Hollywood, when women worked at all levels of the film industry – directing, editing, producing and designing. Scriptwriting, Loos’s forte, was the most feminine department: a “manless Eden” of female screenplay writers, scenario authors, story editors, intertitle artists and “script girls”. Loos may not have been the most successful screenwriter during Hollywood’s silent years (that honour falls to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Marion"&gt;Frances Marion&lt;/a&gt;), but she was one of its greatest wits, most popular characters and one of its key storytellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loos is best known today for her wickedly funny novel Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, written during her Hollywood years, which follows the escapades of gold-digging, flaxen-haired showgirl Lorelei Lee and her man-mad brunette chum Dorothy. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/25/100-best-novels-gentlemen-prefer-blondes-anita-loos-robert-mccrum"&gt;For many, this breathless novel epitomises the highs and the lows of the jazz age&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s now most famous in its &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/25/gentlemen-prefer-blondes-film-review"&gt;1953 musical film incarnation&lt;/a&gt; starring Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/11/anita-loos-gentlemen-prefer-blondes-screenwriter-silent-era-films"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>China's craze for 'aquatic cocaine' is pushing two species into oblivion</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2016/jan/11/china-aquatic-cocaine-vaquita-totoaba-mexico-endangered-extinct</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Affluent Chinese are putting two Mexican species at risk due to demand for dried swim bladders. But will this year’s Cites meeting on the wildlife trade force a crackdown? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many would probably find the idea of consuming a fish’s swim bladder unappetizing. More still would be unwilling to part with &amp;pound;2,000 for such a bladder, otherwise known as a maw. But China’s demand for swim bladders from a giant Mexican fish – the totoaba – is not only putting it at risk, but also the world’s smallest porpoise, the vaquita (“little cow” in Spanish). Today, there are fewer than 100 vaquitas in the world, and no one knows how many totoaba are left. Given the dire state of these two species, conservationists hope that a meeting of the international convention on endangered species (Cites) in Geneva this week will take strong action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The vaquita’s extinction clock stands at one minute to midnight and the species is being pushed into oblivion by the demand of a relatively small number of Chinese consumers of totoaba maw,” said Clare Perry, the team leader of the &lt;a href="https://eia-international.org/"&gt;Environmental Investigation Agency&lt;/a&gt;’s (EIA) oceans campaign. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2016/jan/11/china-aquatic-cocaine-vaquita-totoaba-mexico-endangered-extinct"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Syria: 'You can't have an entire population dependent on aid'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/12/syria-entire-population-dependent-aid</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;NGOs are attempting to provide jobs but immediate humanitarian needs are overwhelming moves towards longer term solutions for people in Syria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the brutality that has come to characterise Syria’s four-year war, it is understandable that discussion of the conflict has focused on violent deaths. But there is another scourge destroying lives in the country: economic ruin and crippling poverty – what a UN-backed &lt;a href="http://www.sy.undp.org/content/dam/syria/docs/socio-economic-resilience/SCPR_Alienation_Violence_Report_2014_EN.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) called “an equally horrendous but silent disaster”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some aid organisations and policy experts are finding that, with more than four out of five Syrians in poverty, traditional humanitarian aid, while necessary, just isn’t enough. So they’re advocating for, and implementing, livelihood projects – intervention to assist people’s abilities to support themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/12/syria-entire-population-dependent-aid"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>What will Zac Goldsmith's '2-for-1' Housing Bill amendment achieve?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/jan/11/what-will-zac-goldsmiths-2-for-1-housing-bill-amendment-achieve</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s jerry-built legislation that will hurt many Londoners, though parts of the capital and some of its people might gain from adjustments secured by Tory MPs &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zac Goldsmith’s New Year come-on to London voters was public confirmation that the government has accepted a Conservative amendment to its &lt;a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/211600.html"&gt;jerry-built&lt;/a&gt; Housing and Planning Bill requiring each vacant council house forcibly sold in London to be replaced by two new “affordable” ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This foregone conclusion was announced as part of a bunch of measures Goldsmith and David Cameron say will produce 10,000 new “affordable” dwellings on top of 50,000 the prime minister claims other policies will generate in London. Under a &lt;a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/cameron-pledges-to-protect-capital-s-affordable-homes-a3148141.html"&gt;joint byline in the Evening Standard&lt;/a&gt; the pair were explicit about their motive: “Our mission for 2016 is to help Londoners of all incomes find a foothold on the housing ladder.” They described their approach as “radical”. Might it also be “&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/06/jon-snow-zac-goldsmith-played-the-race-card_n_8924736.html"&gt;divisive&lt;/a&gt;”? Does it have anything going for it at all?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/jan/11/what-will-zac-goldsmiths-2-for-1-housing-bill-amendment-achieve"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Help inform our journalism on the Global development desk by telling us what you would like to see us cover this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year was a crucial one for development; 2016 is set to be a challenging one as countries attempt to make good on the pledges they made in 2015. Leaders will be expected to convey their plans for implementing the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-united-nations"&gt;sustainable development goals&lt;/a&gt; – an ambitious plan to end poverty and inequality by 2030 – as well as show commitments to meet the climate deal negotiated in Paris in December.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week we’ll be speaking to the physicist and the comedian ahead of the latest series of The Infinite Monkey Cage and we want to ask them your questions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How big is the universe? What causes supernovas? What’s the food like in the BBC canteen? How much does Things Can Only Get Better earn in royalties each year? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the mysteries you can finally get to the bottom of with our readers’ Q&amp;amp;A with Brian Cox and Robin Ince, co-presenters of Radio 4’s award-winning science and comedy show The Infinite Monkey Cage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/11/got-a-question-for-brian-cox-and-robin-ince-we-want-to-hear-it"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Savio Nsereko is one of the Premier League's worst ever record signings</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2016/jan/12/west-ham-worst-record-signing-premier-league-savio-nsereko</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;West Ham brought in £14m when they sold Craig Bellamy to Manchester City but the majority of that money was wasted in an inexplicably terrible deal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Mase159"&gt;Tom Mason&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://thesefootballtimes.co/"&gt;These Football Times&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/guardian-sport-network"&gt;Guardian Sport Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been some dreadful club record signings in Premier League history. The broadcast TV deals of this era have granted football clubs Scrooge McDuck levels of wealth. Unfortunately, this has often left them with more money than sense as they recklessly invest vast sums into players with a wanton disregard for the consequences, effectively lighting their cigars with rolled up &amp;pound;50 notes like cartoon villains. Although there are many instances of clubs splashing cash on players who turned out to be utterly useless for them, there is one example that stands head and shoulders above the rest. Step forward Savio Nsereko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 2009 was a relatively exciting period of time at West Ham. They were still owned by the Icelandic consortium headed by Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson and the club was a few months into the reign of Gianfranco Zola, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/11/westham.zola"&gt;who had been appointed manager&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/03/westhamunited.premierleague1"&gt;Alan Curbishley’s resignation&lt;/a&gt; the previous September. Although there were were apprehensions from fans about the appointment, the Italian was beginning to win over fans by playing an expansive and creative brand of football.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2016/jan/12/west-ham-worst-record-signing-premier-league-savio-nsereko"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Working as a journalist on zero-hour contracts feels grossly hypocritical</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/jan/11/working-as-a-journalist-on-zero-hour-contracts-feels-grossly-hypocritical</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite being a national journalist, I have no guaranteed income, no sick pay and can be dropped on a whim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m one of many freelancers working in broadcast journalism at a national level. It probably sounds exciting, and it can be. The only drawback is I’m on a zero-hours contract. Frame it how you like, but I have no guaranteed hours a month and, therefore, no guaranteed income. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel nostalgic for a time when, although I was stuck in a rut and rather bored, I had security, stability and a routine. People say it’s good to get out of your comfort zone but I can’t even remember what mine is. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/jan/11/working-as-a-journalist-on-zero-hour-contracts-feels-grossly-hypocritical"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Are you cutting back on alcohol in line with the new guidelines?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/08/are-you-cutting-back-on-alcohol-in-line-with-the-new-guidelines</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New UK guidelines &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/08/mens-recommended-maximum-weekly-alcohol-units-cut-14"&gt;recommend men cut their alcohol intake to 14 units a week&lt;/a&gt; and warn that any amout of alcohol consumption increases cancer risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January is traditionally a time when people in Britain consider taking a break from alcohol, but the latest guidelines from the UK’s chief medical officers suggest more long-term changes could be necessary. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/08/mens-recommended-maximum-weekly-alcohol-units-cut-14"&gt;Men have been advised to drink no more than seven pints of beer a week&lt;/a&gt; - in line with the recommended maximum for women - and experts warn that any amount of alcohol consumption increases cancer risk for either sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines, the first issue in twenty years, represent a toughening up of the advice in line with the latest research. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/08/are-you-cutting-back-on-alcohol-in-line-with-the-new-guidelines"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How Halifax Town were hypnotised into shocking Manchester City in the FA Cup</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2016/jan/08/halifax-town-hypnotist-manchester-city-fa-cup-shock</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Malcolm Allison’s alleged failure to pay for the services of a hypnotist came back to haunt him in the FA Cup third round in 1980, when his team of expensive imports were humbled by a hardworking Halifax side at their muddy ground&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/1980ssportsblog"&gt;Steven Pye&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/that-1980s-sports-blog"&gt;That 1980s Sports Blog&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/guardian-sport-network"&gt;Guardian Sport Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was probably the last thing that Malcolm Allison wanted. After spending big at the start of the 1979-80 season, the pressure was building on Manchester City’s manager as the new decade commenced, and a trip to Fourth Division Halifax Town in the third round of the FA Cup awaited as the vultures circled. Taking on an improving Halifax was bad enough, but for Allison the tie would also see him lock horns again with an old foe from the past. It didn’t just rain on Saturday January 5 for Allison; it well and truly poured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting in &lt;a href="http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/division-one-old/1979-1980/table/1980-01-01"&gt;16th place in the top flight in January 1980&lt;/a&gt;, the City board and supporters expected more. In the previous summer Allison had been appointed manager, with Tony Book stepping up to General Manager. City had won the League Cup in 1976 and finished second in the league in 1976-77 under Book, so Allison’s appointment in July 1979 was a gamble by chairman Peter Swales. It was a decision he would come to regret.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2016/jan/08/halifax-town-hypnotist-manchester-city-fa-cup-shock"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>'Beyond everything': one woman's ghostly odyssey around Ireland</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/12/bertien-van-manens-beyond-maps-and-atlases-ireland</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dutch photographer Bertien van Manen made repeated trips to Ireland after losing her husband, and death was a shadowy presence on the fantasy isle wherever she pointed her lens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where can it be found again, an elsewhere world, beyond maps and atlases,” wrote Seamus Heaney in the final lines of &lt;a href="http://poetryindex.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/herbal.html"&gt;A Herbal&lt;/a&gt;, a poem in which human mortality is contrasted with the circular and continuous life force that is nature – lush grass growing from earth in a graveyard. When Dutch photographer, &lt;a href="http://www.bertienvanmanen.nl/"&gt;Bertien van Manen&lt;/a&gt;, was searching for a title for her new book, which was made during several visits to Ireland in the wake of her husband’s death, she came upon the line and was immediately taken by its evocation of “that faraway world that is beyond everything”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/12/bertien-van-manens-beyond-maps-and-atlases-ireland"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rafael Nadal’s face is a picture of focus and concentration as he serves to Lleyton Hewitt during their World team v Australia &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast4_Tennis"&gt;FAST4 Tennis&lt;/a&gt; exhibition match in Sydney, which Hewitt won 4-2, 4-2. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rafaelnadal"&gt;Nadal&lt;/a&gt; was joined by Gaël Monfils and Mats Wilander as the World team defeated &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lleyton-hewitt"&gt;Hewitt&lt;/a&gt;, Nick Kyrgios and Pat Cash’s Australia team over a number of singles and doubles games. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The FAST4 Tennis format offers a faster match, has fewer sets and varied rules to the traditional rules of tennis. It has been described as the tennis equivalent of the Twenty20 cricket&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/picture/2016/jan/12/sport-picture-of-the-day-rafael-nadal-keeps-his-eyes-on-the-ball"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>David Bowie fans pay tribute with mass sing-along in Brixton – video</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-fans-pay-tribute-with-mass-sing-along-in-brixton-video</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;David Bowie fans gather in Brixton, south London, where the singer was born in 1947, for an impromptu street party on Monday. Fans stage a mass sing-along to some of their favourite Bowie tracks after the singer died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 69. He was known for experimenting across diverse musical genres, and for his alter egos Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane and the Thin White Duke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amateur footage courtesy of: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FDuarte_RV%3Fcn%3DcmVwbHk%253D%26refsrc%3Demail&amp;amp;t=1&amp;amp;cn=cmVwbHk%3D&amp;amp;sig=9a7fd0b0b71b8f5e370c388e58b517dcf17df8b3&amp;amp;iid=7e948c159b05431b878e1bb1c3ca1f41&amp;amp;uid=590105787&amp;amp;nid=27+231"&gt;@Duarte_RV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnakednoiseuk%3Ft%3D1%26cn%3DZm9sbG93ZXI%253D%26sig%3De2ab22edcb581da9aee98fdbfa40286c7e7e7611%26al%3D1%26refsrc%3Demail%26iid%3Dd7e0faabc3dc405a927fef934f5a798e%26autoactions%3D1452552789%26uid%3D590105787%26nid%3D23%2B1110&amp;amp;t=1&amp;amp;cn=Zm9sbG93ZXI%3D&amp;amp;sig=ae67f7f47ac742d385a3b6dd361c04499cd2f3d7&amp;amp;iid=d7e0faabc3dc405a927fef934f5a798e&amp;amp;uid=590105787&amp;amp;nid=23+1110"&gt;@SmokeandSaltLDN, @nakednoiseuk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-1947-2016-video-tribute"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘An extraordinary, otherworldly, alien creature’: David Bowie 1947-2016 - video tribute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-television-interviews-video"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bowie in his own words: highlights from his TV interviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-fans-pay-tribute-with-mass-sing-along-in-brixton-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>'I was just a slave': the foreign domestic staff living a life of five-star serfdom in London – video</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;They live in some of London’s most exclusive locations, cooking, cleaning and caring for the children of a rich foreign elite. But for many overseas domestic workers, the veneer of reflected glamour conceals a much darker world, one in which they are denied a passport, salary, food and even sleep while working 20-hour days. Unable to sever ties with their employers due to UK visa restrictions, and fearful of deportation or even arrest if they turn to the authorities, their only real source of hope lies with the small but increasingly vocal group of women who help them escape, and are now fighting to secure a change in the law&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ames have been changed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/11/domestic-workers-abused-uk-london-gulf-state-employers-iron-pressed-my-hand"&gt;‘She took the iron and pressed it on my hand’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/11/uk-increasing-abuse-foreign-maids-tied-visas"&gt;UK visa policy ‘increasing abuse’ of foreign maids, says damning review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2016/jan/11/i-was-just-a-slave-the-foreign-domestic-staff-living-a-life-of-five-star-serfdom-in-london-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why are junior doctors going on strike? - video explainer</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/jan/11/why-are-junior-doctors-going-on-strike-video-explainer</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Junior doctors are preparing to go on strike for 24 hours from 8am on Tuesday, the first such action in 40 years. It comes after talks broke down with the government over a new contract which doctors say will have an impact on patient safety and would see junior doctors paid less for out-of-hours work&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2016/jan/11/why-are-junior-doctors-going-on-strike-video-explainer"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Guardian’s Caspar Llewellyn Smith, Harriet Gibsone and Michael Hann look back at the extraordinary career of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-dies-at-the-age-of-69"&gt;David Bowie who has died at the age of 69&lt;/a&gt;. From his first appearance on Top of the Pops in the early 1970s to his critically acclaimed final album, Bowie has pushed musical boundaries while creating a sound that is uniquely his own &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-1947-2016-video-tribute"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Varna Road in Birmingham was a demonised district in 1960s Britain ... until the US photographer Janet Mendelsohn arrived and captured the tenderness and warmth amid the poverty, pimps and prostitution&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/11/wickedest-road-in-britain-photographer-janet-mendelsohn-varna-road-birmingham"&gt;The photos that told the truth about red light Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ikon-gallery.org/event/janet-mendelsohn/"&gt;Janet Mendelsohn: Varna Road&lt;/a&gt; is at Ikon Gallery in Birming from 27 January to 3 April 2016&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jan/11/tin-baths-beehives-and-brothels-life-on-the-wickedest-road-in-britain-in-pictures"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The grand bazaar in the Turkish city is one of the world’s oldest covered markets. More than 250,000 people a day are thought to visit its 3,000-plus stalls. Despite an increase in shopping malls in Turkey, it was listed as the world’s most visited tourist attraction in 2014&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/jan/11/market-traders-istanbul-grand-bazaar-turkey-in-pictures"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Fashion for all ages: activewear – in pictures</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/jan/08/fashion-for-all-ages-activewear-in-pictures</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest, exercise can be tough, but at least we can make it a bit more fun – or brighten things up, anyway – with what we wear. And the brighter, the better. Lily’s bold neon hoodie and even bolder leggings are just the thing. Pinks work well, too – see April’s fluorescent leggings, Michele’s sweatshirt or Sylviane’s capris. Paired with orange, they give a colour pop your gym buddies will appreciate. The other option is to make like a true athlete and go for muted tones (see Tasia’s blue and black combo). The downside? There’s no excuse for skipping a session. &lt;strong&gt;Melanie Wilkinson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photographs: David Newby for the Guardian. Stylist: Melanie Wilkinson. Stylist’s assistant: Billie Brand. Makeup: Lisa Stokes using Clarins and Essie. &lt;br&gt; Hair: Shukeel Murtaza using Bumble and bumble. Models: April at M&amp;amp;P, Sylviane at Ugly, Tasia at Premier, Lily at Milk and Michele Ronson at Storm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/jan/08/fashion-for-all-ages-activewear-in-pictures"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Prints of darkness: macabre vintage posters – in pictures</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jan/09/prints-of-darkness-macabre-vintage-posters-in-pictures</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before TV and radio, the main way of reaching the public was with large, eye-catching posters. Theatre, silent film and opera would be advertised with colourful images fixed to walls or fences. Most have been lost or destroyed, but Los Angeles art gallery Century Guild has a collection of peculiar and macabre prints from Germany, Austria, France and Italy dating back to 1880-1890. “What I find most striking is the modernity of the visual message,” says the gallery’s founder, Thomas Negovan. “We tend to view the turn of the century through a sepia-toned lens of quaintness, when the truth is that the world then was just as dynamic and thrilling as our lives are today.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://centuryguild.net/collections/limited-edition-patronage-prints"&gt;centuryguild.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jan/09/prints-of-darkness-macabre-vintage-posters-in-pictures"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Stephen Leather accused of cyberbullying by fellow thriller writers</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/12/stephen-leather-cyberbullying-steve-mosby-jeremy-duns</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The bestselling author is alleged to have set up fake websites to smear novelists Steve Mosby and Jeremy Duns, in a row over the practice of ‘sockpuppeting’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bestselling thriller writer Stephen Leather has been accused of “smearing” and “cyberbullying” two fellow authors in a lengthy online campaign described as “despicable” by one of its alleged victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past week, the authors Steve Mosby and Jeremy Duns have each alleged that Leather is behind websites set up to attack them. On 4 January, Mosby blogged about the launch of the site &lt;a href="http://fuckstevemosby.com/"&gt;fuckstevemosby.com&lt;/a&gt;, which featured an exhaustive collection of the times he swore online. Mosby &lt;a href="http://www.theleftroom.co.uk/?page_id=243"&gt;claims that the site was set up by Leather&lt;/a&gt;. Duns, the author of the Paul Dark spy novels, then blogged &lt;a href="http://www.jeremy-duns.com/blog/theauthorwhocyberstalkedme"&gt;a lengthy analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the reasons why he believes Leather is behind a series of sites abusing him – including the claim that the recently established site &lt;a href="http://fuckjeremyduns.com/"&gt;fuckjeremyduns.com&lt;/a&gt; briefly redirected to &lt;a href="http://www.spidershepherd.com/"&gt;Leather’s own site about his character Spider Shepherd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/12/stephen-leather-cyberbullying-steve-mosby-jeremy-duns"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Charles Dance: TV’s go-to toff might be charming but he’s not posh</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Game of Thrones star – who has been stealing roles from actual posh people for years – is concerned that today’s state-educated actors won’t have the chance to do the same &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name: &lt;/strong&gt;Charles Dance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age: &lt;/strong&gt;69.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2016/jan/12/charles-dance-toff-concerned-state-educated-actors"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Hunter S Thompson's son: 'Whatever my father's virtues, he was a basket case'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/12/juan-thompson-book-hunter-s-thompson-stories-i-tell-myself</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Juan Thompson attempts to humanize the ‘crazy gonzo journalist’ without giving in to sentiment in his new book recounting his father’s ‘dysfunctional’ life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter S Thompson was known for lots of things: the frenetic pace of his writing, his fondness for guns, smoking with a clear plastic filter known as a TarGard. And, of course, taking drugs and drinking alcohol at a rate rivaled only by the likes of Keith Richards. It is not necessarily what one would want in a father, but Juan Thompson didn’t have much of a choice. He was simply born to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his father killed himself in 2005, Thompson felt that all the portraits of his father as a manic partier were missing something. “So much of [the media coverage] really focused on this crazy gonzo journalist,” Thompson said in a phone interview last week after the release of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Tell-Myself-Growing-Thompson/dp/0307265358"&gt;Stories I Tell Myself: Growing Up With Hunter S Thompson&lt;/a&gt;. “I felt this compulsion to point out that there was this other dimension to him, as a person and as a writer.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/12/juan-thompson-book-hunter-s-thompson-stories-i-tell-myself"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Media watchdog receives complaints after footage is aired of David Bowie’s ex-wife in tears after she was told off-screen about the star’s death&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channel 5 has come under fire after Angie Bowie was shown on Celebrity Big Brother in tears after being told of the death of her former husband David.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broadcaster said &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/angie-bowie-unaware-david-bowie-death-celebrity-big-brother"&gt;Angie had decided to stay in the house after being told off-screen of the 69-year-old singer’s death&lt;/a&gt;. She was later shown in its diary room crying before being comforted by housemates John Partridge and David Gest. The footage was also used to trail the programme.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/12/celebrity-big-brother-c5-angie-bowie-crying-david-bowie"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>BBC Young Dancer finalist Vidya Patel: 'Your feet are almost a musical instrument'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/stage/dance-blog/2016/jan/12/bbc-young-dancer-vidya-patel-kathak-indian-classical-dance</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The rising dance star on the exchange of ideas in her collaboration with Richard Alston, kathak’s rhythm and grace, and meditating before rehearsal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaching the final of the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p023t1xz"&gt;BBC Young Dancer competition&lt;/a&gt; last year opened a lot of doors for me, especially as a young south Asian artist. It was a massive help in letting people see what I could do. I performed at Latitude with Sadler’s Wells, and at Wembley stadium for the Indian prime minister &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/13/narendra-modi-cheers-wembley-reception-india"&gt;Narendra Modi’s visit&lt;/a&gt; in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.richardalstondance.com/"&gt;Richard Alston&lt;/a&gt; invited me to be in his new work. &lt;a href="http://www.sadlerswells.com/whats-on/2016/richard-alston-dance-company-an-italian-in-madrid/"&gt;An Italian in Madrid&lt;/a&gt; is influenced by the life of the Italian composer Domenico Scarlatti, who moved to Spain and created more than 150 sonatas for Princess Maria B&amp;aacute;rbara. His work became very much influenced by Spanish music and guitar. The music is absolutely beautiful, and Richard’s piece is about the mixing of cultures. For me, it’s also about how I am being influenced by contemporary dance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/dance-blog/2016/jan/12/bbc-young-dancer-vidya-patel-kathak-indian-classical-dance"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Cult heroes: Virgo – obscure Chicago house duo full of mournful mystique</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jan/12/cult-heroes-virgo-obscure-chicago-house-duo-full-of-mournful-mystique</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Their truly original 1989 LP wasn’t even by Virgo, nor was it actually an album. But Eric Lewis and Merwyn Sanders created an introspective dance music classic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a great line in Bob Stanley’s self-styled “story of modern pop”, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/06/story-modern-pop-bob-stanley-review"&gt;Yeah Yeah Yeah&lt;/a&gt;, where he mentions the back sleeves of the three House Sound of Chicago compilations that London Records released between 1986 and 1987. It’s hard to convey how inexplicable the music on them was in the British pop landscape of the time, how alien and strange it seemed when the opening track of Volume 1, Steve “Silk” Hurley’s Jack Your Body, turned up on Top of the Pops, at the top of a chart that featured No More the Fool by Elkie Brooks, Randy Crawford’s Almaz and Genesis’s Land of Confusion. It’s easy to snigger at Radio 1’s Peter Powell announcing that he was retiring, because if music like that could get to No 1, he no longer understood modern pop, but he wasn’t the only person who felt like that. And, as Stanley points out, rather than clarify the music they contained, the photos on the rear of the House Sound of Chicago albums only seemed to compound its weirdness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monochrome pictures of Marshall Jefferson and Steve ‘Silk’ Hurley were reminiscent of Delta blues singers, or the deep soul singers simultaneously anthologised on the Charly label: grainy, lost, a parallel and exciting America … Where did they come from? How could this have been going on while Steve Wright in the afternoon was playing Johnny Hates Jazz? They were unknowable. Such mystique.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jan/12/cult-heroes-virgo-obscure-chicago-house-duo-full-of-mournful-mystique"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Country’s attorney general says actor was under surveillance as photographs reveal Hollywood star turned gonzo journalist was the ultimate tip-off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sean Penn’s &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/10/sean-penn-el-chapo-interview-rolling-stone-missing-editor"&gt;foray into the world of gonzo journalism&lt;/a&gt; led directly to the capture of Mexico’s most wanted criminal, said the country’s attorney general on Monday, as leaked photographs appeared to show that the Hollywood star was under surveillance as he made his way to meet &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/joachim-el-chapo-guzm-n"&gt;Joaqu&amp;iacute;n “El Chapo” Guzm&amp;aacute;n&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico’s attorney general, Arely G&amp;oacute;mez, said that Penn’s journey to the rugged Sierra Madre mountains was “essential” to tipping them off to the drug lord’s whereabouts, according to Reuters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/11/sean-penn-joaquin-el-chapo-guzman-surveillance-capture-photos"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Dark matter and dinosaurs: meet Lisa Randall, America’s superstar scientist</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/12/dark-matter-physics-dinosaurs-extinction-lisa-randell</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Harvard professor’s radical theory of dark matter wiping out the dinosaurs and enigmatic research on extra dimensions has made her a true trailblazer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a bright, chilly winter morning in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in Peet’s cafe, just around the corner from Harvard University, the coffee grinders are going hell for leather. Hunched over their laptops, students peer at seemingly never-ending dissertations while the edge is taken off their caffeine spikes by a soundtrack of soporific crooning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bag two chairs and wait for &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/jun/21/highereducation.highereducationprofile"&gt;Lisa Randall&lt;/a&gt; to walk through the door. America’s superstar scientist turns up a little late, negotiates the throng and perches her petite figure on a stool. But while the surroundings are humdrum, our discussion is anything but. Because Randall is here to talk about &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2015/nov/15/light-and-dark-matter-in-durham"&gt;dark matter – and dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt;. Or, more precisely, how a putative disc of dark matter in our galaxy could potentially be responsible for dislodging lumps of rock from the distant Oort cloud which then hurtle towards Earth – possibly leading to events as catastrophic as the planet’s fifth mass extinction – every 35 million years, or so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/12/dark-matter-physics-dinosaurs-extinction-lisa-randell"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Refaai Hamo lost his wife and daughter when a missile hit his home in Syria. Now the scientist is resettled in Michigan and hopes to help ‘make America strong’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little more than a month ago, Refaai Hamo knew nothing about the suburb of Detroit into which he and his family had been resettled. It didn’t matter. He simply hoped it was safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/10/state-of-the-union-address-barack-obama-non-traditional-focus-on-future"&gt;'Non-traditional' State of the Union address will focus on America's future&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/11/syrian-refugee-thrilled-first-lady-guest-state-of-the-union-address"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Assassin director: why I gave plot the chop</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/11/hou-hsiao-hsien-the-assassin-martial-arts-movies</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In his new kung fu epic The Assassin, Hou Hsiao-hsien finds new ways to tell a story. He explains why he doesn’t care about pleasing his audience&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396284/"&gt;Hou Hsiao-hsien&lt;/a&gt; sits at a table beside the window, gazing out at the narrow street. He has a bottle of water and a packet of lozenges for his throat. His baseball cap is pulled so low that his eyes are in shadow. Jessica the translator says: “Look at the man looking out of the window. Look at the man looking out at the road. Is he suffering from worry, fear or joy of life?” I stare at the director. I stare at the translator. Is the question rhetorical or are they expecting an answer? This interview is not quite five minutes old and I feel we have already wandered some way off the path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feted by the critics, lauded by his peers, Hou makes films that pride themselves on being more poetry than prose, more fugue than symphony. He wants to kick away the bricks of conventional narrative and ride the thermals of a purely visual language. “Plot,” he says and shakes his head dismissively. “I don’t think that plot is the only way to appeal to an audience. The audience can catch the message of a film through landscape, character, details.” Then he sneezes like a thunderclap and turns his gaze back to the glass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/11/hou-hsiao-hsien-the-assassin-martial-arts-movies"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
